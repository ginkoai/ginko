description: Quick recalibration check when feeling lost or misaligned
---

Let's do a quick vibecheck to ensure we're on the right track.

**Your concern:** $ARGUMENTS

**Current Situation Assessment:**
1. What were we originally trying to achieve?
2. What have we actually done so far?
3. Are we solving the right problem?

**Addressing your specific concern:**
Based on "$ARGUMENTS", let me evaluate:
- Is this concern valid?
- How does it affect our current approach?
- What adjustments might we need?

**Alignment Check:**
- Is the current approach the simplest solution?
- Are we overcomplicating things?
- Have the requirements changed or evolved?

**Course Correction:**
- Should we continue on the current path?
- Do we need to pivot to a different approach?
- Is there a simpler way to achieve the goal?

**Clear Next Steps:**
Based on this vibecheck and your concern about "$ARGUMENTS", here's what I recommend:
1. The single most important thing to do next
2. What success looks like for that step
3. Any blockers that need addressing first

Remember: A vibecheck is about recalibration, not criticism. It's a tool for productive collaboration and keeping work focused.
