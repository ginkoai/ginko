Load the project context using /mcp context to:
- Get the latest best practices
- Resume your previous session automatically  
- Show current team activity
- Load project overview

After loading context, if a handoff was resumed, always use the assess_handoff_quality MCP tool to evaluate how well the handoff prepared you for the work ahead. This provides valuable feedback for improving future session transitions.

This ensures you're synchronized with the team and continuing from where you left off.
