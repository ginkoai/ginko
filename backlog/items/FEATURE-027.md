# Real-Time Notification System

## Problem Statement
Users miss important updates and events because they must manually refresh pages to see new information. This leads to delayed responses to critical notifications, reduced engagement, and users feeling disconnected from real-time collaboration features. Support tickets show 68% of users want instant notifications without constant page refreshing.

## Solution
Implement a WebSocket-based real-time notification system using Socket.io for cross-browser compatibility. The system will push notifications for new messages, status updates, mentions, and system alerts. Notifications will appear as toast messages in-app and optionally as browser notifications with user permission.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Notifications appear within 2 seconds of triggering event
- [ ] Users can enable/disable notification categories in settings
- [ ] System handles reconnection gracefully after network interruption
- [ ] Notification queue prevents overwhelming users (max 3 visible)
- [ ] Browser notifications work when app is in background (with permission)
- [ ] Unread notification count shows in favicon/title
- [ ] Click notification navigates to relevant content
- [ ] Works across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Stories

- [ ] STORY-XXX: Notification UI components and toasts
- [ ] STORY-XXX: User notification preferences
- [ ] STORY-XXX: Browser notification integration

## Technical Notes
**Architecture:**
- WebSocket server alongside Express app
- Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling
- Event-driven architecture with typed events
- Fallback to polling for WebSocket-blocked networks

**Security:**
- JWT authentication for WebSocket connections
- Rate limiting (100 notifications/user/hour)
- XSS protection in notification content
- Only send notifications user is authorized to see

**Performance:**
- Batch notifications sent within 100ms window
- Compress WebSocket frames
- Monitor memory usage for connection pools

## Dependencies
- socket.io (server and client)
- redis (for pub/sub across server instances)
- Requires authentication system (FEATURE-022, FEATURE-024, FEATURE-026)
- Needs infrastructure for WebSocket deployment
