# Sprint: Quality & Stability

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Sprint Goal**: Achieve production-ready quality with 80%+ test coverage on core init functionality, clean up technical debt, and deliver the --quick flag quick win
**Duration**: 14-19 hours (2-3 days)

## 🎯 Sprint Planning

### Theme: Production Readiness & Technical Debt

After completing the Configuration and Reference System sprint (TASK-009 through TASK-014), this sprint focuses on solidifying the foundation with comprehensive testing and addressing technical debt that has accumulated.

### Backlog Items Selected

   - ProjectAnalyzer tests (4-6h)
   - ProgressiveLearning tests (3-4h)
   - Init command tests (3-4h)
   - E2E init flow tests (2-3h)
   - **Current State**: 0% test coverage on core init functionality
   - **Risk**: Production bugs, cross-platform issues, false positives

2. **[TASK-006] Implement functional --quick flag** (2 story points) - HIGH
   - 1 hour quick win
   - Flag exists but non-functional
   - Immediate user value

3. **[BUG-FIX] Fix ginko backlog exit code** (1 story point)
   - `ginko backlog` returns error exit code when no subcommand provided

**Order of execution:**

1. Fix `ginko backlog` exit code bug (0.5h)
2. Fix COMPLETION-STATUS backlog parsing (0.5h)
3. Mark FEATURE-024 complete (0.5h)
4. Implement TASK-006: --quick flag (1-2h)
5. Verify all quick wins, commit and push

### Testing Implementation (Day 1-2, 12-17 hours)

**TASK-007 breakdown:**

#### Phase 1: ProjectAnalyzer Tests (4-6 hours)
- Package manager detection (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun)
- Project type classification (webapp/api/cli/library/monorepo)
- Framework detection (React/Next.js/Vue/Express/NestJS)

- Test setup detection (Jest/Vitest/pytest/go test)
- Command extraction from package.json
- Error handling (missing package.json, invalid JSON)
- `quickAnalyze()` static method

#### Phase 2: ProgressiveLearning Tests (3-4 hours)
- `getUserProgress()` creates new progress
- `updateProgress()` increments command usage
- `getContextualHint()` applies all filters correctly
- Hint dependencies and ordering logic
- Experience level calculation (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- showOnce behavior prevents repeat hints
- File I/O error handling (graceful failures)
- Smart suggestions based on git status

#### Phase 3: Init Command Tests (3-4 hours)
- Directory structure creation (.ginko/sessions, patterns, context)
- Config.json generation with correct defaults
- .gitignore updates (append vs create)
- Integration with ProjectAnalyzer
- Integration with AiInstructionsTemplate
- Already-initialized detection (current dir)
- Already-initialized detection (parent dir)
- Error handling and cleanup on failure
- User session directory setup with email slug

#### Phase 4: E2E Init Flow Tests (2-3 hours)
- Complete init in temp directory (setup/teardown)
- React project initialization
- API project initialization
- CLI project initialization
- Monorepo initialization
- No package.json scenario (generic init)
- Verify all files created correctly
- Verify CLAUDE.md content quality
- Test --quick flag behavior
- Test --analyze flag behavior

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `packages/cli/test/analysis/`, `packages/cli/test/utils/`, `packages/cli/test/commands/`
- E2E tests: `packages/cli/test/e2e/`

### Test Patterns to Follow
- Reference: `packages/cli/test/templates/ai-instructions-template.test.ts` (HIGH quality, 17 test cases)
- Reference: `packages/cli/test/e2e/session-logging-flow.test.ts` (455 lines, comprehensive)

### Testing Strategy
- Mock file system operations where appropriate
- Use temp directories for E2E tests
- Test edge cases (no git, Windows paths, permission errors)
- Validate error messages are helpful
- Test cross-platform compatibility

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

### Issue 1: ginko backlog exit code
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Description**: `ginko backlog` without subcommand returns non-zero exit code
- **Expected**: Return 0 and show help text
- **File**: `packages/cli/src/commands/backlog/*.ts`

### Issue 2: COMPLETION-STATUS files in backlog
- **Impact**: Low (cosmetic)
- **Description**: `*-COMPLETION-STATUS.md` files appear as backlog items
- **Expected**: Exclude documentation files from backlog listing
- **File**: Backlog parser/lister

### Issue 3: FEATURE-024 status outdated
- **Impact**: Low (documentation)
- **Description**: Parent feature still marked IN_PROGRESS despite all tasks complete
- **Expected**: Status should be "complete"
- **File**: `backlog/items/FEATURE-024-configuration-and-reference-system.md`

6. ✅ Previous sprint properly closed (FEATURE-24 complete)
7. ✅ CI pipeline validates all tests (if applicable)
8. ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

**Quality bar:**
- All tests must be meaningful (not just coverage padding)
- Edge cases must be tested (errors, missing files, etc.)
- Cross-platform compatibility considered
- Tests must be maintainable and well-documented

## 📈 Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Time estimate accuracy**: Testing often takes longer than expected
- **Mitigation**: Break into phases, validate estimates after Phase 1

### Medium Risk
- **Test infrastructure issues**: Vitest/Jest conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Fix infrastructure first before writing tests

### Low Risk
- **Quick wins**: Bug fixes and --quick flag are straightforward
- **Mitigation**: Start with these to build confidence

## 🔮 Post-Sprint Planning

### If sprint completes early (>95% velocity)
Consider picking up:
- TASK-008: Interactive mode for first-time setup (3-4h)
- FEATURE-030: Generate context modules from ProjectAnalyzer (4-6h)

### If sprint runs over (velocity <80%)
Defer to next sprint:
- E2E tests (keep unit tests as priority)
- Some edge case coverage

### Next sprint candidates (after this)
1. **Workflow Domain Reflections** (FEATURE-029) - High strategic value
2. **Init Enhancement** (TASK-008, FEATURE-030) - Complete init feature set
3. **Additional testing** - Expand coverage to other commands
