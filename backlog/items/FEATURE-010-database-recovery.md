# Database Failure Recovery & Monitoring

## Problem Statement
System needs automatic recovery from database failures with proper monitoring to ensure reliability and data integrity. Currently no fallback mechanism when database is unavailable.

## Solution
Implement automatic recovery with exponential backoff, in-memory fallback, monitoring alerts, and data synchronization after recovery.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero data loss during outages
- [ ] <5 minute detection time
- [ ] Automatic recovery without manual intervention
- [ ] Team notifications within 1 minute
- [ ] Post-incident reports generated

## Implementation Requirements
- Exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s)
- In-memory fallback with data queuing
- PagerDuty/Slack notifications on failure
- Data sync after recovery
- Health check monitoring every 60s
- Incident reporting automation

## Recovery Procedures
1. **On Failure**: Switch to in-memory + alert ops team
2. **During Outage**: Queue critical data, retry connection
3. **On Recovery**: Validate stability, sync data, notify team
4. **Post-Recovery**: Generate incident report

## Technical Notes
- Use connection pooling with retry logic
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Queue using Redis or in-memory buffer
- Health endpoint for monitoring services
- Structured logging for incident analysis

## Dependencies
- Monitoring infrastructure (PagerDuty/Slack)
- Redis for queue (optional)
- Health check endpoint
