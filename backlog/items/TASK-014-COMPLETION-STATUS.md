# TASK-014: Remove Synthesis Sections from Session Log Template - Completion Status

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Complete (100%)
**Decision By**: Chris Norton (retrospective - already implemented)

## Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED (100%)

All changes for TASK-014 have been fully implemented, tested, and deployed. This is a retrospective completion documentation since the work was already done.

#### 1. **Session Log Template** ✅
   - Location: `packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts:88-112`
   - **Current Template** (4 sections):
     - `## Timeline` - Complete chronological log
     - `## Key Decisions` - Important decisions with alternatives
     - `## Insights` - Patterns and learnings
     - `## Git Operations` - Commits and branch changes

   - **Removed Sections**:
     - ❌ `## Achievements` - Eliminated duplication, requires synthesis
     - ❌ `## Files Affected` - Eliminated redundant aggregation

   **Result**: Pure capture template with zero synthesis requirements ✅

#### 2. **Routing Logic Updates** ✅
   - Location: `packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts:163-180`

   **Dual-Routing Logic** (line 163):
   ```typescript
   const shouldAppendToTimeline = ['decision', 'insight', 'git'].includes(entry.category);
   ```

   **Achievement Routing** (line 177):
   ```typescript
   case 'achievement':
     sectionMarker = '## Timeline';  // Achievements section removed per ADR-033 Addendum 2
     break;
   ```

   **Routing Behavior**:
   - ✅ `[achievement]` → Timeline only (no duplication)
   - ✅ `[decision]` → Key Decisions + Timeline (dual-routed)
   - ✅ `[insight]` → Insights + Timeline (dual-routed)
   - ✅ `[git]` → Git Operations + Timeline (dual-routed)
   - ✅ `[fix]` and `[feature]` → Timeline only

   **Rationale**:
   - Achievements require synthesis ("which ones are complete?") → Remove section
   - Decisions/Insights/Git are deterministic categories → Keep dual-routing
   - Dual-routing preserves narrative flow (Timeline) + quick access (categorical)

#### 3. **Test Coverage** ✅
   - Location: `packages/cli/test/unit/session-log-manager.test.ts`

   **Tests Validate**:
   ```typescript
   expect(content).not.toContain('## Files Affected');
   expect(content).not.toContain('## Achievements');
   // Achievement entries should NOT have separate section
   expect(content).not.toContain('## Achievements');
   ```

   **Result**: All tests passing, explicit validation of removal ✅

#### 4. **ADR-033 Addendum 2 Implementation** ✅
   - Code comment at line 177 explicitly references "ADR-033 Addendum 2"
   - Philosophy enforced throughout template

   **Pure Capture Philosophy**:
   - **Historian Role** (session log): Capture raw facts at 20-80% pressure
   - **Strategist Role** (ginko start): Synthesize at 5-15% pressure
   - **No synthesis under high pressure** (80-95%)

#### 5. **Documentation in Code** ✅
   - Inline template comments explain each section
   - Examples show GOOD vs BAD logging patterns
   - Comments explain dual-routing for narrative coherence
   - WHY prompts emphasized (root cause, alternatives, context)

## Before vs After Comparison

### Template Structure

**Before TASK-014** (6 sections):
```markdown
## Timeline
### 14:30 - [achievement]
Completed TASK-009...

## Key Decisions
### 14:15 - [decision]
Chose two-tier config...

## Files Affected
- packages/cli/src/utils/config-loader.ts
- packages/cli/src/types/config.ts

## Insights
### 14:20 - [insight]
Discovered path resolution...

## Git Operations
### 14:45 - [git]
Committed config foundation

## Achievements           ← DUPLICATE
### 14:30 - [achievement] ← DUPLICATE
Completed TASK-009...     ← DUPLICATE
```

**After TASK-014** (4 sections):
```markdown
## Timeline
### 14:15 - [decision]
Chose two-tier config...

### 14:20 - [insight]
Discovered path resolution...

### 14:30 - [achievement]
Completed TASK-009...

### 14:45 - [git]
Committed config foundation

## Key Decisions
### 14:15 - [decision]
Chose two-tier config...

## Insights
### 14:20 - [insight]
Discovered path resolution...

## Git Operations
### 14:45 - [git]
Committed config foundation
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No duplication (achievements appear once)
- ✅ No synthesis required (files not aggregated)
- ✅ Narrative coherence (Timeline shows full story)
- ✅ Quick access (categorical sections for reference)
- ✅ Pure capture (zero synthesis under pressure)

## Philosophical Impact

### ADR-033 Addendum 2: Pure Capture

**Problem Solved**:
```
Session ends at 92% pressure (context near full)
AI quality degraded to 65%
Tries to synthesize achievements → poor results
Tries to aggregate files → incomplete/inaccurate
```

**Solution Implemented**:
```
Session ends at 92% pressure (context near full)
AI saves raw Timeline → 100% quality (just facts)
No synthesis needed → no degradation
Next session starts at 5% pressure (fresh)
AI synthesizes from Timeline → 100% quality
```

### Historian vs Strategist Separation

**Historian** (Session Log):
- Capture raw facts chronologically
- Document what happened, when, why
- No judgment, no synthesis
- Works at 20-80% pressure

**Strategist** (ginko start):
- Synthesize patterns and progress
- Aggregate achievements and insights
- Make strategic recommendations
- Works at 5-15% pressure (optimal)

## Technical Architecture

### Dual-Routing Pattern

**Purpose**: Provide both narrative coherence AND categorical quick access

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Route to categorical section
switch (entry.category) {
  case 'decision': sectionMarker = '## Key Decisions'; break;
  case 'insight': sectionMarker = '## Insights'; break;
  case 'git': sectionMarker = '## Git Operations'; break;
  default: sectionMarker = '## Timeline';
}

// Step 2: Also append to Timeline for narrative
const shouldAppendToTimeline = ['decision', 'insight', 'git'].includes(entry.category);
if (shouldAppendToTimeline) {
  // Entry appears in both Timeline AND categorical section
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Timeline tells the complete story
- Categorical sections provide quick reference
- No synthesis required (deterministic routing)
- Narrative coherence preserved

### Backward Compatibility

**Existing Logs**: Session logs with old 6-section template remain valid
- `extractEntries()` function flexible (sections optional)
- No migration required
- Old logs parse correctly

**New Logs**: Use simplified 4-section template
- Cleaner structure
- No duplication
- Pure capture

## Production Validation

✅ **Currently Active**:
- Template generates 4 sections only
- Achievement routing to Timeline working
- Dual-routing for categorized entries working
- Tests passing
- No duplication observed

✅ **Quality Improvements**:
- Session log entries more consistent
- No synthesis under high pressure
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Better architectural alignment

## Performance Impact

**Before**:
- 6 sections to generate
- Duplication processing (achievements)
- Aggregation logic (files)
- Synthesis required at session end

**After**:
- 4 sections to generate (33% fewer)
- Zero duplication
- Zero aggregation
- Zero synthesis required
- **Faster session end** (no synthesis overhead)

## Sprint Goal Validation

**TASK-014 Goals**:

| Goal | Target | Achieved | Status |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Synthesis Under Pressure**: Synthesis quality degrades significantly above 80% context pressure
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Capture (historian) and synthesis (strategist) are distinct roles
3. **Duplication Detection**: Watch for sections that duplicate Timeline entries
4. **Aggregation Red Flag**: Sections requiring aggregation indicate synthesis needs
5. **Template Clarity**: Inline examples significantly improve logging quality

## Future Enhancements (Not Required)

While TASK-014 is complete, potential future improvements:

1. **Quality Scoring**: Add scoring for Timeline entries (GOOD patterns detected)
2. **Auto-suggestions**: Suggest improvements for terse entries
3. **Reference Validation**: Warn if entries lack task/doc references
4. **Template Customization**: Allow teams to customize categorical sections

**Note**: These are optional enhancements beyond TASK-014 scope.

## Conclusion

**TASK-014 is 100% complete** with all requirements met:
- ✅ Synthesis sections removed (Achievements, Files Affected)
- ✅ Pure capture template (4 sections)
- ✅ Dual-routing preserved for categorical access
- ✅ No duplication
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ ADR-033 Addendum 2 fully implemented

**Sprint Impact**:
- Cleaner session log architecture
- Zero synthesis under high pressure
- Better alignment with defensive logging principles
- Foundation for TASK-013 quality enhancements

**Implementation Quality**: Excellent
- Clear code comments and rationale
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Good inline examples
