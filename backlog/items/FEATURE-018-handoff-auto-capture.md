# Enhanced Handoff with Automatic Context Capture

## Problem Statement
Every development session contains 3-6 pivotal learning moments that are lost 90% of the time because capturing them interrupts flow. This forces both humans and AI to repeatedly rediscover the same insights, wasting hours per week. The `ginko capture` command exists but goes unused due to friction.

## Solution
Embed automatic context capture directly into the `ginko handoff` command, making learning preservation zero-friction. AI analyzes the session for insights and creates context cards automatically during the natural handoff pause.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 90% knowledge capture rate (vs 10% current)
- [ ] 2-4 hours saved per developer per week
- [ ] 3x improvement in AI assistance effectiveness
- [ ] Zero additional time required from developer

## Implementation Approach
```bash
ginko handoff
# → AI analyzes session for insights
# → Creates context cards automatically  
# → Generates handoff with card references
# → User reviews and commits
# → Next session has full context
```

## What Gets Captured
- Problem-solution pairs discovered
- Architecture decisions made
- Performance optimizations found
- Gotchas and workarounds
- Pattern recognitions
- Tool/library discoveries

## Technical Notes
- Integrates with existing handoff workflow
- Uses AI to identify high-value insights
- Stores in `.ginko/context/modules/`
- Referenced in session handoffs

## Dependencies
- Existing handoff command
- AI analysis capabilities
- Context module system
