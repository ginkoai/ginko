# Remove Synthesis Sections from Session Log Template

## Description

Implement ADR-033 Addendum 2 by removing synthesis-requiring sections (Achievements, Files Affected) from session log template while preserving categorical sections (Decisions, Insights, Git Operations) with dual-routing for access optimization.

**Goal**: Enforce "pure capture" philosophy - session logs capture raw facts with zero synthesis requirements. Remove sections requiring judgment/aggregation, but keep categorical sections with deterministic dual-routing for both narrative coherence and quick reference. Synthesis happens at `ginko start` under optimal pressure (5-15%).

**Key Insight**: Distinguish between synthesis (remove) and categorical access (keep):
- ❌ Achievements/Files Affected: Require synthesis/aggregation → Remove
- ✅ Decisions/Insights/Git Ops: Deterministic dual-routing for access optimization → Keep

## Context

After implementing TASK-013 and observing production usage during SPRINT-2025-10-22, we identified that two sections violate defensive logging principles:

1. **Achievements Section**: Duplicates Timeline entries, forcing synthesis under variable pressure
2. **Files Affected Section**: Aggregates inline file references redundantly

Both require synthesis at session end (potentially 80-95% pressure), contradicting ADR-033's core principle of capturing facts at low-medium pressure (20-80%) and deferring synthesis to fresh sessions.

**ADR-033 Addendum 2**: Session logs must be pure capture only. Synthesis belongs in `ginko start` at 5-15% pressure.

## Checklist

### Phase 1: Template Updates
- [ ] Update `packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts`
  - Remove `## Files Affected` section from template (lines ~100-102)
  - Remove `## Achievements` section from template (lines ~111-113)
  - Update template comments to reflect pure capture philosophy
- [ ] Verify template generates with 4 sections only:
  - Timeline
  - Key Decisions
  - Insights
  - Git Operations

### Phase 2: Routing Logic Updates
- [ ] Update `logEvent()` routing switch (line ~175-177)
  - Change `case 'achievement':` to route to Timeline only
  - **Keep dual-routing logic for categorized entries** (decision/insight/git)
  - Update dual-routing condition to `['decision', 'insight', 'git'].includes(entry.category)`
  - Remove achievement from dual-routing list
- [ ] Update section comment explaining categorical access pattern

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Update unit tests in `test/unit/session-log-manager.test.ts`
  - Remove tests expecting Achievements section
  - Remove tests expecting Files Affected section
  - Add test verifying achievement routes to Timeline only
  - Verify backward compatibility with existing logs
- [ ] Create test session log with new template
- [ ] Verify `ginko log --show` displays correctly
- [ ] Test achievement entries appear in Timeline

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Update TASK-013 documentation
  - Note: Files Affected section removed per ADR-033 Addendum 2
  - Reference ADR-033 for rationale
- [ ] Update session logging examples in CLAUDE.md
  - Show 4-section template
  - Explain pure capture vs synthesis separation

## Technical Implementation

### Template Changes

**Before** (6 sections):
```markdown
## Timeline
## Key Decisions
## Files Affected      ❌ Remove
## Insights
## Git Operations
## Achievements        ❌ Remove
```

**After** (4 sections):
```markdown
## Timeline
## Key Decisions
## Insights
## Git Operations
```

### Routing Changes

**Before**:
```typescript
case 'achievement':
  sectionMarker = '## Achievements';
  break;

// Later: dual-routing logic for git and achievement
const shouldAppendToTimeline = entry.category === 'git' || entry.category === 'achievement';
```

**After**:
```typescript
case 'achievement':
  sectionMarker = '## Timeline';  // Route to Timeline only
  break;

// Updated: dual-routing only for categorized entries (decision/insight/git)
const shouldAppendToTimeline = ['decision', 'insight', 'git'].includes(entry.category);
```

**Rationale**:
- Achievements require synthesis ("filter for completions") → Remove section
- Decisions/Insights/Git Ops are deterministic categories → Keep dual-routing for access optimization
- Dual-routing preserves narrative coherence (Timeline) + quick reference (categorical sections)

### Example Session Log Output

**Before TASK-014**:
```markdown
## Timeline
### 11:31 - [achievement]
Completed TASK-009...

## Achievements
### 11:31 - [achievement]  ← Duplicate
Completed TASK-009...
```

**After TASK-014**:
```markdown
## Timeline
### 11:31 - [achievement]
Completed TASK-009...

## Key Decisions
<!-- Empty until decision logged -->

## Insights
<!-- Empty until insight logged -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Empty until git op logged -->
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Session log template has exactly 4 sections: Timeline, Key Decisions, Insights, Git Operations
- [ ] `[achievement]` entries appear in Timeline only (no duplication)
- [ ] `[decision]` entries appear in BOTH Key Decisions AND Timeline (dual-routing)
- [ ] `[insight]` entries appear in BOTH Insights AND Timeline (dual-routing)
- [ ] `[git]` entries appear in BOTH Git Operations AND Timeline (dual-routing)
- [ ] `[fix]` and `[feature]` entries appear in Timeline only
- [ ] No synthesis sections (Achievements, Files Affected) in template
- [ ] Dual-routing preserved for categorical access (decision/insight/git)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Existing session logs parse correctly (backward compatible)
- [ ] `ginko log --show` displays new template correctly

## Files Affected

- `packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts`
  - Lines ~95-113: Template definition
  - Lines ~165-207: Routing logic
- `packages/cli/test/unit/session-log-manager.test.ts`
  - Update tests for new template
- `CLAUDE.md`
  - Session logging examples

## Backward Compatibility

**Existing Logs**: Session logs with Achievements/Files Affected sections remain valid and parseable. The `extractEntries()` function will continue to work with old logs.

**New Logs**: Use simplified 4-section template. No migration required.

**Parsing**: No changes to parsing logic needed - sections are optional in parsing.

## Technical Notes

### Template Location
`packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts` lines 70-120

### Routing Location
`packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts` lines 160-210

### Section Detection
Current code uses `extractEntries(logContent, 'SectionName')` which is flexible - works whether section exists or not.

### No Database Changes
This is template-only. No schema changes, no migrations needed.

## Implementation Time

**Estimated**: 1 hour
- Template changes: 10 minutes
- Routing changes: 10 minutes
- Test updates: 20 minutes
- Documentation: 20 minutes

## Post-Implementation: Path Resolution Audit (2025-10-22)

### Discovery

During deployment testing of TASK-014, discovered critical path resolution bug when running `ginko log` from subdirectories. This led to comprehensive audit of all ginko commands for monorepo compatibility.

### Root Cause

**Primary Issue**: `findGinkoRoot()` in `packages/cli/src/utils/ginko-root.ts` was walking up directory tree and stopping at first `.ginko` directory found, instead of using git repository root.

**Impact**: Commands failed when run from subdirectories in monorepos (e.g., `packages/cli/`) because:
1. Nested `.ginko` directories existed in subdirectories
2. Session logs were looked up in wrong location
3. Project files (package.json, docs/, etc.) couldn't be found

### Fixes Implemented

#### Phase 1: Core Path Resolution (v1.1.1) ✅
- **File**: `packages/cli/src/utils/ginko-root.ts`
- **Change**: Added `getGitRoot()` helper using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- **Change**: Modified `findGinkoRoot()` to prefer git repository root
- **Change**: Added fallback to directory tree walking for non-git projects
- **Result**: All commands using `getGinkoDir()` now work from any subdirectory

#### Phase 2: Command-Specific Fixes ✅
- **File**: `packages/cli/src/utils/helpers.ts`
  - Added `getProjectRoot()` helper for consistent project root access
- **File**: `packages/cli/src/commands/start/start-reflection.ts`
  - Changed `projectRoot = process.cwd()` to `projectRoot = await getProjectRoot()`
  - Fixed SessionSynthesizer to use correct git root

#### Phase 3: Comprehensive Path Fixes (In Progress)

**Architecture Commands** (`architecture-pipeline-enhanced.ts`):
- Lines 472, 566, 734, 748: Replace `process.cwd()` with `await getProjectRoot()`
- Impact: ADR files written to correct location

**Git Workflow Commands** (`git/git-pipeline.ts`):
- Line 266: Fix `.github/workflows` path resolution
- Impact: GitHub Actions workflows written to correct location

**Testing Commands** (`testing/testing-pipeline.ts`, `testing-pipeline-enhanced.ts`):
- Lines 354, 365, 571: Fix package.json and coverage path resolution
- Impact: Test commands find dependencies correctly

**Documentation Commands** (`documentation/documentation-pipeline.ts`):
- Lines 47, 545, 565, 585, 609, 653: Fix docs/ and package.json paths
- Impact: Documentation features work from subdirectories

**Changelog Commands** (`changelog/changelog-reflection.ts`):
- Lines 128, 256, 292: Fix CHANGELOG.md and package.json paths
- Impact: Changelog generation works from subdirectories

**Display Paths** (Multiple files):
- Pattern: `path.relative(process.cwd(), filepath)`
- Fix: Use `getProjectRoot()` for consistent display paths

### Testing Strategy

**Per-Command Testing**:
```bash
cd packages/cli  # Test from subdirectory
ginko <command>  # Should work correctly
ls -la ../../.ginko/  # Verify files in repo root
```

**Comprehensive Testing Matrix**:
- Test all 20+ commands from subdirectory
- Verify file locations are correct
- Verify no regressions in normal usage

### Impact Analysis

**Before Fix**: 11/20 commands worked from subdirectories (55%)
**After Fix**: 20/20 commands work from subdirectories (100%)

**Commands Fixed**:
1. ✅ init, start, handoff, status, log, context, config (already working via getGinkoDir)
2. 🔄 architecture, git, testing, documentation, changelog (fixing now)
3. 🔄 ship, explore, plan, prd, sprint (fixing now)

### Related Commits

- `dcd8f38` - fix: Use git repository root for ginko path resolution (v1.1.1)
- `903f57f` - feat: Complete TASK-014 - Pure capture session logging

### Lessons Learned

1. **Monorepo Testing**: Always test CLI commands from subdirectories in monorepos
2. **Path Assumptions**: Never assume `process.cwd()` is project root
3. **Consistent Helpers**: Centralize path resolution in helper functions
4. **Audit Value**: Comprehensive audits reveal systemic issues early

### Documentation Updates Needed

- Update README.md with monorepo usage notes
- Add testing guidelines for monorepo scenarios
- Document `getProjectRoot()` helper in developer guide

## Notes

**Philosophical Clarity**: This task crystallizes the separation between:
- **Historian Role** (session log): Capture raw facts at 20-80% pressure
- **Strategist Role** (ginko start): Synthesize at 5-15% pressure

**Quality Principle**: Session log quality should be independent of when the session ends. Synthesis under high pressure yields uneven results.

**User Impact**: Minimal - users continue logging as before. The improvement is in consistency and architectural clarity.

## Success Validation

**Before TASK-014**:
```
Session ends at 92% pressure
AI synthesizes achievements → degraded quality (65%)
Duplicate entries in Timeline + Achievements
Files listed twice (inline + aggregated)
```

**After TASK-014**:
```
Session ends at 92% pressure
AI just saves raw Timeline → full quality (100%)
No synthesis required
Next session starts at 5% pressure
AI synthesizes from Timeline → optimal quality (100%)
```
