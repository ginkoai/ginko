# Evidence Pages Required for Ginko Browser Extension

## Overview
Each coaching message in the browser extension makes a specific claim backed by evidence. We need to create these evidence pages on ginko.ai to build trust, demonstrate expertise, and create a marketing pipeline.

## Required Evidence Pages

### 1. Fresh Context (`/evidence/fresh-context`)
**Claim**: "Fresh context - ideal for complex work"
**Evidence Needed**:
- Cognitive load research on working memory limits
- Studies on context switching costs
- Data on error rates vs. session duration
- Best practices for tackling complex problems

**UTM Tracking**: `?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=coaching&utm_campaign=context`

### 2. Optimal Zone (`/evidence/optimal-zone`)
**Claim**: "Optimal collaboration zone (10-30 minutes)"
**Evidence Needed**:
- Flow state research
- Productivity studies on ideal work sessions
- AI collaboration patterns from real usage data
- Comparison of session lengths vs. output quality

**UTM Tracking**: `?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=coaching&utm_campaign=optimal`

### 3. Context Degradation (`/evidence/context-degradation`)
**Claim**: "Context degrades 43% after 30 min"
**Evidence Needed**:
- Quantitative analysis of Claude's context window
- Token usage patterns over time
- Error rate increase after 30 minutes
- Response quality metrics vs. session duration
- **SOURCE: This 43% number needs backing or adjustment**

**UTM Tracking**: `?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=coaching&utm_campaign=warning`

### 4. Session Effectiveness (`/evidence/session-effectiveness`)
**Claim**: "Session effectiveness dropped 67% after 45 minutes"
**Evidence Needed**:
- Completion rate data
- Rework frequency analysis
- Time-to-solution metrics
- User satisfaction scores vs. session length
- **SOURCE: This 67% number needs validation**

**UTM Tracking**: `?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=coaching&utm_campaign=critical`

### 5. Optimal Timing (`/evidence/optimal-timing`)
**Claim**: "Handoffs before 30 minutes are optimal"
**Evidence Needed**:
- Success rate comparisons
- Time saved calculations
- Context preservation metrics
- Best practices from power users

**UTM Tracking**: `?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=insights&utm_campaign=quality-a`

### 6. Handoff Timing (`/evidence/handoff-timing`)
**Claim**: "Earlier handoffs improve complex work"
**Evidence Needed**:
- Complex task breakdown strategies
- Context preservation techniques
- Case studies of successful handoffs
- Timing recommendations by task type

**UTM Tracking**: `?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=insights&utm_campaign=quality-b`

## Page Structure Template

Each evidence page should include:

```markdown
# [Claim Statement]

## The Research
- Key finding with specific percentage/metric
- Methodology (how we measured this)
- Sample size and data source

## Why This Matters
- Impact on productivity
- Cost of ignoring this principle
- Real-world implications

## How to Apply This
- Specific actionable steps
- Tools that help (link to extension)
- Best practices

## See It In Action
- Case study or example
- Before/after comparison
- Video demonstration (if applicable)

## Get Started
- CTA to install extension
- Link to CLI for power users
- Join the community
```

## Data Collection Needed

To make these evidence pages credible, we need:

1. **User Session Analytics**
   - Average session duration
   - Handoff frequency
   - Success metrics

2. **A/B Testing Results**
   - Sessions with handoffs vs. without
   - Different handoff timings
   - Template usage effectiveness

3. **External Research**
   - Cognitive science papers on working memory
   - Software engineering productivity studies
   - AI collaboration research

4. **Our Own Analysis**
   - Token usage patterns in Claude
   - Context window degradation measurements
   - Error rate analysis over time

## Marketing Integration

Each evidence page becomes:
- **Trust Builder**: Scientific backing for our claims
- **Education Tool**: Teaching better collaboration
- **Conversion Path**: Evidence → Try Extension → Upgrade to CLI
- **SEO Asset**: Ranking for "Claude productivity" searches
- **Social Proof**: Shareable insights

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Create placeholder pages with "Research in progress" 
2. **Week 1**: Gather existing research and studies
3. **Week 2**: Run initial data analysis on any available metrics
4. **Week 3**: Publish first versions with real data
5. **Ongoing**: Update with user data as we collect it

## Alternative Approach if Data Unavailable

If we can't substantiate specific percentages:
- Change "43% degradation" to "significant degradation"
- Change "67% drop" to "substantial effectiveness loss"
- Focus on qualitative evidence and user testimonials
- Use ranges instead of specific numbers

## Notes

- Every claim needs a source or should be modified
- UTM parameters enable conversion tracking
- Pages should load fast and be mobile-friendly
- Include schema markup for search engines
- Add social sharing buttons for viral potential
