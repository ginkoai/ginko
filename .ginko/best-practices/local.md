# Local Development Best Practices

## Session Management
- `ginko start` - Begin new session with context loading
- `ginko handoff` - Save progress for seamless continuation
- `ginko vibecheck` - Quick realignment when stuck

## Development Workflow
1. Check what exists: `ls -la` relevant directories
2. Find examples: Look for similar features already implemented
3. Test existing: Try current endpoints/features first
4. Plan, implement, test, document
