# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T03-00-55-426Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 22:08 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 22:08

Completed TASK-011: Removed cursors, implemented chronological loading. Root cause: Cursors over-engineered for simple 'last N events' use case (YAGNI). Solution: Created loadRecentEvents() with ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50, no state tracking. Deprecated session-cursor.ts, removed cursor creation from start-reflection.ts. Benefits: Simpler architecture, no stale cursor bugs, faster feedback loop. Impact: Eliminated ~100-200 lines of state management complexity, always-fresh event loading. Files: packages/cli/src/lib/context-loader-events.ts:123-197, packages/cli/src/commands/start/start-reflection.ts:75-77,119-132,245-250, packages/cli/src/lib/session-cursor.ts:1-17

### 22:26 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 22:26

Completed TASK-012: Implemented cloud-only mode for dual-write elimination. Root cause: Dual-write (local files + graph) masks graph bugs with silent fallback. Solution: Added GINKO_CLOUD_ONLY env var that disables local file writes and fails loudly if graph unavailable. Benefits: (1) Fail-fast discovery of graph bugs, (2) Faster feedback loop for reliability improvements, (3) Single source of truth preparation. Implementation: Modified event-logger.ts to check cloudOnly flag and skip appendToLocalFile(), modified context-loader-events.ts to throw errors instead of falling back. Impact: Ready for TASK-013 graph reliability testing. Files: packages/cli/src/lib/event-logger.ts:177-206, packages/cli/src/lib/context-loader-events.ts:149-214
