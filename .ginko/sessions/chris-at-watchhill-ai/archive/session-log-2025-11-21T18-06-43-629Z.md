# Session Log: session-2025-11-21T17-32-29-954Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 12:38 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 12:38

Completed TASK-1 end-to-end charter sync! Fixed user/token access issue by creating Graph node (graphId: gin_1762125961056_dg4bsd, userId: user_dGVzdF90 derived from bearer token). Tested production API at https://app.ginkoai.com/api/v1/charter/sync - successfully created 21 nodes (1 Epic, 5 Problems, 9 Goals, 6 Users) and 24 relationships (Epic→Problem SOLVES, Epic→Goal HAS_GOAL, Problem→User IMPACTS). Verified data in Neo4j: all nodes and relationships present. Created helper scripts: scripts/create-graph-node.ts, scripts/test-charter-sync.ts, scripts/verify-charter-graph.ts. TASK-1 Phase 1 now 100% complete!

### 12:52 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 12:52

Completed TASK-1 & TASK-2 implementation and deployment! TASK-1: Fixed Graph node access issue (created user_dGVzdF90 → gin_1762125961056_dg4bsd mapping), tested charter sync end-to-end (21 nodes, 24 relationships verified in Neo4j). TASK-2: Built complete Sprint→Task graph sync infrastructure using 3 parallel subagents - sprint parser (407 lines), 2 API endpoints (sync + active), 69 unit tests (816 lines). Committed 12 files (2205 insertions) and pushed to GitHub. Vercel deployment auto-triggered. Next: Verify production deployment and test sprint sync end-to-end.

- dashboard/src/app/api/v1/sprint/sync/route.ts
- dashboard/src/app/api/v1/sprint/active/route.ts

### 12:57 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 12:57

TASK-2 deployment and verification complete! Deployed to production (Vercel build: 57s), tested both API endpoints successfully (POST /sprint/sync returned 200 OK with 5 nodes + 5 relationships, GET /sprint/active returned 200 OK in 247ms). Verified in Neo4j: 1 Sprint node, 4 Task nodes with complete metadata (titles, priorities, files, ADRs), CONTAINS relationships (4), NEXT_TASK relationship (1). All parsing working correctly: task extraction, status normalization, priority levels, file detection, ADR references. Production-ready sprint graph infrastructure now live.
