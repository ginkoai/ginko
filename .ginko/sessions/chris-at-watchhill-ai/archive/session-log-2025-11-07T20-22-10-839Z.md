# Session Log: session-2025-11-07T19-29-50-099Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 14:45 - [achievement]
Completed integration testing phase for Knowledge Management API. Created comprehensive test suites for both REST and GraphQL endpoints: REST API - 29 tests covering all 5 CRUD endpoints (GET list, GET by ID, POST create, PUT update, DELETE). GraphQL API - 15 tests covering all 8 queries (search, nodesByTag, nodeGraph, node, nodes, contextualNodes, adrsByPrd, implementationProgress). Note: 4 GraphQL mutations are skipped as resolvers not yet implemented. Tests use Jest with mocked CloudGraphClient, Neo4j runQuery, and Voyage AI embeddings. All tests passing. Test files: dashboard/src/app/api/v1/knowledge/__tests__/integration/nodes.test.ts (REST) and dashboard/src/app/api/graphql/__tests__/integration/graphql.test.ts (GraphQL).
Files: dashboard/src/app/api/v1/knowledge/__tests__/integration/nodes.test.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/graphql/__tests__/integration/graphql.test.ts, dashboard/jest.config.js, dashboard/jest.setup.js, dashboard/package.json
Impact: high


### 15:13 - [decision]
Architectural decision: Removed GraphQL mutations from API. GraphQL is now read-only for complex queries and graph traversal. Write operations (create, update, delete) exclusively use REST API (/api/v1/knowledge/nodes). Rationale: (1) REST already implemented and tested (29 tests), (2) Natural separation of concerns - GraphQL for reads, REST for writes, (3) Industry pattern (GitHub, Shopify), (4) Less code duplication. Updated GraphQL schema, tests, and GraphiQL documentation. All 15 GraphQL tests passing (queries only).
Alternatives: Option A: REST only for writes (CHOSEN), Option B: Implement GraphQL mutations (duplicate REST functionality), Option C: Expose Cypher directly (security risk). Chose Option A for simplicity, industry patterns, and leveraging existing tested REST implementation.

Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->
