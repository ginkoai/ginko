# Session Log: session-2025-11-10T18-56-58-302Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 14:06 - [achievement]
Completed charter TypeScript types foundation - comprehensive type system with 40+ interfaces covering charter content, confidence scoring, conversation context, versioning, storage, and validation. Includes work mode characteristics, confidence thresholds, and type guards. Foundation ready for storage and conversational system implementation.
Files: packages/cli/src/types/charter.ts
Impact: high


### 14:29 - [achievement]
Completed charter command implementation (TASK-003, TASK-004) - Full conversational charter system with 10 new files (~4,500 lines): types, storage (file+graph), versioning, conversation facilitator, confidence scorer, synthesizer, editor. All TypeScript errors fixed, CLI command registered. Ready for ginko init integration.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/charter.ts, packages/cli/src/types/charter.ts, packages/cli/src/lib/charter/
Impact: high


### 14:30 - [achievement]
Completed charter integration into ginko init (TASK-005) - Seamless conversational charter creation integrated into initialization flow. Charter appears naturally after context setup with 'What would you like to build?' prompt. Includes graceful skip option, error handling, and updated success messages. Integration complete, all phases 1-3 delivered.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
