# Session Log: session-2025-11-07T18-39-42-795Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 14:13 - [achievement]
Completed TASK-021, TASK-024, TASK-025: Full knowledge management API implementation. Created REST API with 5 CRUD endpoints for knowledge nodes (ADR, PRD, ContextModule, Session, CodeFile), GraphQL API with 8 queries + 4 mutations using GraphQL Yoga, and 3 CLI commands (search, create, graph). All TypeScript compilation passes. Documentation complete in docs/api/KNOWLEDGE-API.md and docs/implementation/NEXT-STEPS-KNOWLEDGE-API.md. Ready for testing and deployment phase.
Files: dashboard/src/app/api/v1/knowledge/nodes/route.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/v1/knowledge/nodes/[id]/route.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/graphql/schema.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/graphql/resolvers.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/graphql/route.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/knowledge/index.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/knowledge/search.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/knowledge/create.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/knowledge/graph.ts, docs/api/KNOWLEDGE-API.md, docs/implementation/NEXT-STEPS-KNOWLEDGE-API.md
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
