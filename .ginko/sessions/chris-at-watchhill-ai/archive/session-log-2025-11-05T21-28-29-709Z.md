# Session Log: session-2025-11-05T19-54-44-170Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 15:19 - [fix]
Fixed CLI event sync JSON parse error
Root cause: Missing endpoint on dashboard - existed in api/ but not dashboard/src/app/api/
Files: dashboard/src/app/api/v1/graph/events/route.ts
Impact: high


### 16:21 - [decision]
Created ADR-044 for Neo4j AuraDB migration with event lifecycle
Alternatives: Hetzner+Vercel Static IPs ($20/mo), Fixie proxy ($10/mo), AuraDB Pro from day 1 ($65/mo), custom event storage (dev time). Chose AuraDB Free for $0 cost, managed service, and lifecycle extends capacity to 43 users.
Files: docs/adr/ADR-044-neo4j-auradb-migration.md, BACKLOG.md
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
