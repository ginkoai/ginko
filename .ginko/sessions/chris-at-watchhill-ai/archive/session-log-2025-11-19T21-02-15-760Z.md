# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T18-34-44-008Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 13:35 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 13:35

Debug complete: Fixed strategicContext GraphQL failure and implemented display. Root cause: Dynamic imports returned module object instead of direct exports (fs.existsSync undefined). Solution: Added 'import os from os' at top level, removed dynamic imports in loadStrategicContext(). Display implementation: Added charter/team/patterns sections to start-reflection.ts displaySessionInfo(), mode-aware formatting (Hack & Ship: minimal, Think & Build: balanced, Full Planning: comprehensive). Result: GraphQL query working (0 events/patterns expected - graph empty), display logic ready for when charter/team/patterns exist.

### 15:58 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 15:58

Charter creation complete! Created comprehensive PROJECT-CHARTER.md through AI-mediated natural conversation. Captured Ginko's vision (universal human-AI collaboration infrastructure), pragmatic focus (solo devs + small teams), experiential success criteria (magical experience, rapport continuity, flow state), architectural clarity (graph-first, cloud-native), and key differentiator (rapport over memory). 

Conversation highlights: Chris articulated 5 core problems (context management, rapport loss, flow state disruption, team collaboration, human-centered UX), defined success as 'can't imagine working without it', clarified graph-based architecture with cloud-first approach, identified handoff evolution from synthesis to housekeeping trigger, and emphasized experience over features as competitive moat.

Meta-validation: Charter creation process itself demonstrated Ginko's vision - natural conversation with AI partner that reduced anxiety and crystallized complex thinking. 'This is the kind of magic we must bring to every aspect of ginko.' Charter ready for graph sync and strategic context display testing.
