# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T21-03-23-786Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 16:03 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 16:03

TASK-1 Complete: Charter integration working! Implemented charter-loader.ts that parses PROJECT-CHARTER.md from filesystem, integrated into loadRecentEvents to merge with strategic context, displays in ginko start output. Charter shows purpose + goals in Think & Build mode (mode-aware formatting). Root cause fix: Used git rev-parse --show-toplevel to find project root (not process.cwd()). Result: Charter now visible in every session, AI partners see project mission/goals immediately. Charter parsing extracts: purpose (Solution section), goals (Vision + success criteria), scope boundaries. Files: packages/cli/src/lib/charter-loader.ts (new), packages/cli/src/lib/context-loader-events.ts:232-268. Display format validated: Purpose + Goals for Think & Build mode, clean formatting, proper spacing. AI readiness improved - partners now understand project mission from session start.
