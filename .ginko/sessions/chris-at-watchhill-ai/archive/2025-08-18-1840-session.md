# Session Handoff - Statusline Intelligence Architecture 🎯

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Time**: 20:40  
**Session ID**: statusline-hooks-architecture  
**Author**: Claude + Chris Norton  
**Email**: chris@ginko.ai  
**Branch**: feature/browser-extension  
**Duration**: ~4 hours

## 🎯 Session Summary

**Discovered statusline limitations and architected hook-based solution for intelligent coaching**

This session achieved:
1. **Tool assessment**: All slash commands and statusline tools evaluated
2. **Problem identified**: Claude doesn't pass tool events to statusline
3. **Solution designed**: Hook-based event tracking architecture
4. **POC created**: PostToolUse hook installed and ready to test
5. **Decision plan**: Comprehensive GO/NO-GO framework documented

## 📊 Work Completed

### ✅ Claude Code Tools Assessment
- **Slash commands**: All 8 commands are git-native and HIGH value (KEEP all)
- **Statusline tools**: Working but limited by Claude's API
- **npm package**: v0.6.1 published with transcript reading (unused by Claude)
- **Hook discovery**: Found the solution via PostToolUse hooks

### ✅ Architecture Design
```
Claude Tools → PostToolUse Hook → Session State File → Statusline Reads State
```
- Hooks write to `~/.ginko/sessions/{session_id}.json`
- Statusline reads state for pattern detection
- <500ms latency required for good UX

### ✅ Documentation Created
- `docs/STATUSLINE-HOOKS-DECISION-PLAN.md` - Complete decision framework
- `BACKLOG.md` - Added FEATURE-014 as CRITICAL
- `~/.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.sh` - POC hook implementation

## 🚀 Next Session Tasks

### Phase 1: POC Execution (4 hours)
1. Test hook → state → statusline flow
2. Induce errors to trigger patterns
3. Measure latency (must be <500ms)
4. Test reliability and edge cases

### Decision Checkpoint
- **GO if**: Latency acceptable, patterns detected, value clear
- **NO-GO if**: Performance issues, too complex, better alternative

## 💡 Key Discoveries

### The Core Problem
- Claude statusline receives: `{session_id, cwd, model}`
- Does NOT receive: `transcript_path`, tool events, errors
- Updates only every 300ms when conversation changes

### The Solution
- PostToolUse hook receives EVERYTHING
- Can track errors, patterns, tool usage
- Writes state that statusline can read
- Enables intelligent, responsive coaching

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

### Don't Break
- npm package @ginkoai/mcp-client v0.6.1 is LIVE
- Hooks must pass through input unchanged
- Statusline has 300ms update throttle

### Architecture Risks
- File I/O latency could be too slow
- Concurrent sessions may conflict
- State file corruption possible

## 📟 Current State

```bash
# Hook installed and configured
$ cat ~/.claude/settings.json | jq .hooks
{
  "postToolUse": "/Users/cnorton/.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.sh"
}

# Ready to test
$ tail -f ~/.ginko/hook-test.log
# Waiting for tool events...
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### POC Must Demonstrate
- [ ] <500ms statusline update after tool event
- [ ] Accurate pattern detection (stuck, flow, thrashing)
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Works across session restarts

### Metrics to Track
- Latency: Time from tool → hook → file → statusline
- Accuracy: False positive rate for patterns
- Reliability: Failure rate under load
- Value: Does it actually help developers?

## 🔄 Ready for Handoff

**Next AI**: Execute the POC in Phase 1. Test the hook with deliberate errors. Measure latency carefully. Document results. Make GO/NO-GO recommendation based on actual data.

**Human**: The POC hook is installed. The decision framework is clear. We need data to decide if this architecture is viable.
