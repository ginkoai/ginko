# Session Log: session-2025-11-10T19-48-50-816Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 15:09 - [achievement]
Completed E2E testing for charter and init commands. Fixed critical regex bug in charter --view (regex quantifier escaping). Verified charter creation, viewing, and init integration. Added charter integration tests to E2E suite. Charter storage works for both file (docs/PROJECT-CHARTER.md) and graph (best-effort). All manual tests passed.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/charter.ts, packages/cli/src/lib/charter/charter-storage.ts, packages/cli/test/e2e/init-flow.test.ts, packages/shared/src/lib/embeddings/voyage-client.ts
Impact: high


### 18:02 - [achievement]
BREAKTHROUGH: Complete OAuth authentication flow now working end-to-end. Fixed Row Level Security (RLS) blocking API key generation by implementing service role client bypass. Root cause was using user OAuth token for admin operations (profile creation). Solution: Created createServiceRoleClient() in dashboard/src/lib/supabase/server.ts and updated both profile update and creation in generate-api-key/route.ts to use adminSupabase. Validated: ginko login --force completes successfully, API key generated (gk_cd501ec4...), ginko whoami shows active authentication. Impact: Unblocks UAT testing and v1.4.1 release.
Files: dashboard/src/lib/supabase/server.ts:43-58, dashboard/src/app/api/generate-api-key/route.ts:46, 67, 103

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
