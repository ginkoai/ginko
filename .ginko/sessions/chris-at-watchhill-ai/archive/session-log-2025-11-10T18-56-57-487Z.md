# Session Log: session-2025-11-10T14-52-38-190Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 11:49 - [achievement]
Created SPRINT-2025-11-10: Project Charter & Initialization with conversation-first philosophy. Sprint redesigned based on key insight: charter should emerge naturally from asking 'What would you like to build?' rather than announcing charter creation. Experience should feel like talking to a thoughtful partner, not bureaucratic process. TASK-002 and TASK-004 completely redesigned around conversational system with confidence scoring, gentle nudging, and TBD handling. Charter is evidence of good thinking, not a deliverable. AI positioned as first-class partner whose needs should be respected. Philosophy: Meet humans where they experience flow (talking about ideas, not filling templates).

Impact: high


### 12:42 - [achievement]
Completed comprehensive ginko init architecture audit. Analyzed 3 init implementations (init.ts, init-enhanced.ts, graph/init.ts), identified 5 critical gaps (no graph storage, no charter, duplicate logic, no work mode adaptation, no reflection pattern), and provided detailed recommendations for unified initialization system. Key findings: ADR-037 two-tier config works correctly, but ADR-039 graph integration missing. Recommended unified approach with local-first + optional cloud/charter flags. Full 50-page audit report created at docs/analysis/INIT-AUDIT-2025-11-10.md

Impact: high


### 13:54 - [achievement]
Completed Sprint foundation (TASK-001, TASK-002) with strategic pivot to cloud-first seamless onboarding. Key insights: Target 80%+ users who are marginally-interested, easily-distracted, impatient. Zero-friction experience: 'npm install && ginko init' just works (no flags). Automatic: GitHub OAuth, API key provisioning, free tier (1 graph, 3 projects), cloud project node creation. Charter emerges from natural 'What would you like to build?' conversation using AI's native voice (not canned questions). Documents updated: INIT-AUDIT (cloud-first rationale), SPRINT plan (seamless flow), CONVERSATION-DESIGN (native voice emphasis), 3 example conversations (marked as patterns not scripts). Ready for implementation phase in fresh session.

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
