# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T03-57-11-699Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 23:16 - [achievement]
TASK-013: Testing with deployed initial-load endpoint. Event should now be visible!
Files: .ginko/context/index.json, .ginko/sessions/chris-at-watchhill-ai/current-events.jsonl, .ginko/sessions/chris-at-watchhill-ai/current-session-log.md, .ginko/sessions/chris-at-watchhill-ai/cursors.json, docs/adr/ADR-INDEX.md
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 22:58 - [insight]
# [INSIGHT] 22:58

TASK-013: Completed server-side investigation for Bug #2. Root cause: Events write successfully to /api/v1/graph/events (201 Created) but are not returned by /api/v1/context/initial-load (returns empty array). Added API debug logging to GraphApiClient for detailed request/response tracing. Captured full HTTP traces showing write-read inconsistency. Server-side code investigation blocked - API endpoints deployed separately. Requires Neo4j database query and server endpoint review to resolve.
