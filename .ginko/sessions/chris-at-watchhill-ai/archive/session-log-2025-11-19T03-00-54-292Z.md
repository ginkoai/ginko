# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T01-56-08-462Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 21:57 - [decision]
# [DECISION] 21:57

Completed event loading fixes and pivoted to cloud-first architecture. Fixed 3 critical bugs: (1) Reset stale cursor to latest event (14 days old → current), (2) Improved blocked event detection with smart regex (word boundaries + unblocking words), fixed 24/24 unit tests, (3) Deduplicated events in current-events.jsonl (43 → 41 events, removed 2 duplicates within 10s window). 

Root cause analysis revealed cursors are over-engineered (YAGNI) - we only need simple chronological queries for 'last 50 events'. Investigation showed dual-write (local files + cloud graph) masks cloud graph bugs by falling back to local files. 

Architectural pivot: Created TASK-011 (Remove cursors, use chronological queries), TASK-012 (Eliminate dual-write, cloud-graph-only), TASK-013 (Graph reliability testing). This eliminates state sync complexity, makes cloud graph source of truth, and provides feedback loop to fix graph bugs. Cancelled TASK-010 (cursor advancement) as obsolete.
