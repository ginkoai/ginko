# Session Log: session-2025-11-05T21-28-30-176Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 16:41 - [achievement]
Successfully exported complete Neo4j database from Hetzner (118 nodes, 1,069 relationships, 6.5MB). Export includes all ADRs, PRDs, events, embeddings ready for AuraDB migration per ADR-044.
Files: scripts/export-neo4j-data.ts, export/data.json
Impact: high


### 16:52 - [achievement]
Successfully migrated complete database to Neo4j AuraDB. Imported 118 nodes and 1,069 relationships in 127s with 100% verification. Ready for production deployment.
Files: scripts/import-neo4j-data.ts
Impact: high


### 16:59 - [achievement]
Deployed Ginko to production with AuraDB credentials. API deployed successfully with Neo4j AuraDB connectivity. Migration complete per ADR-044.
Files: .env.vercel
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
