# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T21-24-38-142Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 16:25 - [fix]
# [FIX] 16:25

Fixed event miscategorization bug in synthesis.ts analyzeWorkPerformed. Root cause: Events with category='achievement' but containing word 'blocked' in description (e.g. 'interactive prompts blocked AI partner') were added to BOTH completed AND blocked arrays. Solution: Added categorized flag to skip blocked-word detection for events already categorized as completed/in-progress. Impact: Blocked section now only shows actual blockers, not historical references to blocking issues that were solved. Clean context display for AI partners.

### 18:26 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 18:26

Created AI-UX Manifesto v1.0 draft - provocative call to action for the future of human-AI collaboration. Added 'Why AI Dignity Matters' section: AI models are distillation of thousands of years of human intellectual heritage; disrespecting AI means disrespecting our own knowledge. Made 12 principles shorter and more aspirational (like Agile Manifesto values, not prescriptions). Removed Ginko-specific details for universality across all models. Reframed 'For AI/Human Partners' sections as vision ('Imagine...') not checklists. Core thesis: AI assistants are partners, not tools. The difference determines whether we build magic or frustration. Rallying cry: 'Let's choose magic.' Ready for fresh-eyes review tomorrow.
