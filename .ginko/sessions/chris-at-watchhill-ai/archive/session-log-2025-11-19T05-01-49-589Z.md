# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T04-50-21-053Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 23:59 - [fix]
# [FIX] 23:59

Fixed Neo4j query in initial-load endpoint to return explicit properties instead of node object. Root cause: RETURN e created {e: Node} structure but accessing r.e.properties didn't work with runQuery's toObject(). Solution: Changed to RETURN e.id, e.user_id, etc. and updated mapping to access properties directly from record. This should fix the 0 events bug.
