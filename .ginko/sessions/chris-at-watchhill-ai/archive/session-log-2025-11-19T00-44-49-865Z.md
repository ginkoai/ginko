# Session Log: session-2025-11-19T00-41-18-401Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

### 19:42 - [achievement]
# [ACHIEVEMENT] 19:42

Completed TASK-001 through TASK-004 for SPRINT-2025-11-18. Removed all blocking prompts from ginko log, implemented smart defaults (auto-include files, auto-create context modules, detect category/impact), added educational feedback (quality scoring, WHAT/WHY/HOW breakdown, coaching tips), and fixed session log writing bug (fs-extra ESM import issue). Result: AI partners can now log events without ANY user interaction. Zero prompts, immediate execution, rich educational feedback.
