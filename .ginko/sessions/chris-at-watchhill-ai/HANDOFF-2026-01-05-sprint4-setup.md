## Summary

Verified Sprint 3 completion, set up Sprint 4 with task assignments, and updated documentation to use ginko graph CLI commands instead of curl.

## Completed This Session

### 1. Sprint 3 Verification & Closure
- Cross-referenced git commits with sprint markdown
- Found all 6 tasks were complete but sprint file was outdated
- Updated `SPRINT-2026-02-epic008-sprint3.md` to 100% complete
- Added accomplishment entries for tasks t03-t06
- Marked all success criteria complete

### 2. Sprint 4 Setup
- Created 8 Task nodes in graph via API
- Assigned all tasks to chris@watchhill.ai using `ginko assign`
- Updated sprint markdown with `**Assigned:**` fields
- Set `CURRENT-SPRINT.md` to Sprint 4 (Billing & Seats)

### 3. Epic 008 Updates
- Updated `current_sprint` to e008_s04
- Added Sprint 2 & 3 accomplishment summaries
- Added changelog entry v1.3.0
- Epic is now 75% complete (3/4 sprints done)

### 4. Documentation Updates (CLAUDE.md)
- Replaced curl/API examples with ginko CLI commands
- Documented: `ginko graph query`, `explore`, `status`, `health`
- Documented: `ginko assign`, `ginko sync`
- Updated `ai-instructions-template.ts` (ginko init template)

## Key Insights Logged

1. **Sprint verification pattern**: Cross-reference git commits with sprint markdown to verify actual completion
2. **Decision**: Use ginko CLI over curl for graph operations (handles auth automatically)
3. **Achievement**: Epic 008 at 75% - only billing sprint remains
