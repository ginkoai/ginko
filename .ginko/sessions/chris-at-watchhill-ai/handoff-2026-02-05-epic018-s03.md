### EPIC-018 Sprint 1: Session Resumption Brief (NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Transform `ginko start` from status dashboard to resumption context.

| ID | Task | Done When |
|----|------|-----------|
| e018_s01_t01 | Resumption brief synthesis | Brief shows: last session summary, stopping point, open questions |
| e018_s01_t02 | Files-touched tracking | Files touched visible in brief |
| e018_s01_t03 | Surface open questions | Open questions displayed prominently |
| e018_s01_t04 | Context load performance | Loads in <2 seconds |
| e018_s01_t05 | Clarify ADR architecture status | ADR-043 status clear |

**Note:** Sprint 2 and 3 were completed first. Sprint 1 addresses the "10-second resumption" goal.
