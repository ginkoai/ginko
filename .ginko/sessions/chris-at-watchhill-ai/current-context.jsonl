Created /api/v1/billing/seats/sync endpoint, seat-sync.ts helper, and /api/v1/billing/seats/reconcile for startup reconciliation. Integrated sync triggers into POST /teams/[id]/members, DELETE /teams/[id]/members/[userId], and POST /team/join routes. Proration enabled for additions, disabled for removals (Stripe best practice).","Completed e008_s04_t02: Stripe Per-Seat Product Configuration. Created scripts/stripe-setup-seats.ts to configure Stripe products for Team tier (/seat/month, /seat/year with 17% savings). Script handles product creation, price configuration, and outputs .env variables. Updated .env.example with STRIPE_TEAM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID and STRIPE_TEAM_YEARLY_PRICE_ID placeholders.","Completed e008_s04_t01: Extended billing schema for per-seat billing. Added 'team' tier to PlanTier with /seat/month pricing. Implemented seat management methods in BillingManager (getSeatAllocation, canAddSeats, updateSeatCount, syncSeatCount, getSeatUsageSummary). Created Neo4j schema 013-billing-seats.cypher for SeatAllocation and BillingEvent tracking. Extended entitlements-manager.ts with team tier limits (50 seats, 25 projects). Build passes.","Achievement: Epic 008 Sprint 3 confirmed 100% complete (6/6 tasks). Updated sprint file, epic file, and CURRENT-SPRINT.md. Sprint 4 (Billing & Seats) now active with 8 tasks created and assigned. Epic 008 is 75% complete - only billing sprint remains.","Completed E2E testing task (e008_s03_t06). Created team-onboarding.test.ts covering full invite→join→sync→start flow with timing validation. Created team-collaboration.test.ts covering concurrent edits, owner insights access, and staleness detection. Tests follow skip-if-no-credentials pattern from live-graph-api.test.ts. Sprint 3 now 100% complete.","Completed team features documentation (e008_s03_t05). Created comprehensive docs/guides/team-collaboration.md covering all team commands (invite, join, teams, sync), roles/permissions, staleness warnings, workflow examples for owners and members, and troubleshooting. Updated CLI README with Team Collaboration section. Sprint now at 83%.","Completed progress indicators for onboarding (e008_s03_t03, e008_s03_t04). Added ora spinners with time estimates to sync-command.ts showing per-node progress. Added elapsed-time spinner and step indicators (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) to join flow. Exported formatProgressBar utility. ADR-023 compliant output."],"inProgressWork":["Starting e008_s04_t03: Seat Count Synchronization. Will implement sync between team membership and Stripe subscription seat count.","Starting e008_s04_t02: Stripe Per-Seat Product Configuration. Goal: Create Stripe product with quantity-based per-seat billing for Team tier (/seat/month).","Enhanced CLAUDE.md to induce greater AI logging volume. Changes: (1) Elevated 'Defensive Logging' reflex from #8 to #1, renamed to 'Proactive Logging' with ADR-034 reference; (2) Added mandatory logging checkpoints section with 5 explicit triggers (session start, pre-commit, task completion, 30-min intervals, blockers); (3) Added frequency targets (minimum 3 events/session, target 5-10); (4) Removed 'Works silently' instruction, replaced with proactive logging behavior and brief confirmations. Root cause: insights showed 122 silent sessions and 0.7 events/session vs 2+ target.","Enabled semantic search for ginko graph query. Added Voyage AI API key, created Neo4j vector index (knowledge_embeddings, 1024d), generated embeddings for 71 knowledge nodes (ADRs, PRDs, Patterns, Gotchas), fixed API response format to match CLI expectations. Query now returns ranked results with similarity scores."],"blockedItems":[],"keyDecisions":["Decision: Use ginko CLI commands (ginko graph query, ginko assign, ginko sync) instead of raw curl/API calls for graph operations. CLI handles auth, graph ID, error handling automatically. Updated CLAUDE.md and ai-instructions-template.ts to document this pattern for new projects via ginko init."],"gotchas":[],"resumePoint":"Completed e008_s04_t04: Dashboard Billing Overview.
