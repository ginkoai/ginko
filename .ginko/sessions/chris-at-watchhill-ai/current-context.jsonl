Sprint 2 (e011_s02) marked complete - all 6 tasks done including Edit History & Conflicts.","SESSION HANDOFF: Completed sprint e011_s02 (Edit Capability & Sync). All 6 tasks done. Key deliverables: Edit history display showing 'Edited Xm ago by email@domain.com', conflict detection with ConflictDialog for resolution. Fixes: Neo4j DateTime handling, JWT email extraction. Deployed to app.ginkoai.com.","Fixed edit history display issues: 1) Handle Neo4j DateTime objects in formatRelativeTime(), 2) Extract actual email from Supabase JWT instead of hashing token, 3) Show full email address instead of stripping domain. Edit history now displays correctly as 'Edited Xm ago by user@domain.com'."],"inProgressWork":["Completed task 1: Created graph access verification helper at dashboard/src/lib/graph/access.ts. Implements verifyGraphAccess() that checks: 1) direct ownership (graph.userId === userId), 2) team membership (teams.graph_id lookup), 3) public visibility for read access.
