Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s, max 3 attempts) for network errors and 5xx responses. Created health monitoring system with ginko graph health command tracking success rate, latency, retries. Tested cloud-only mode: 7/7 events succeeded (100%). Infrastructure ready for sustained reliability testing. Sprint progress: 42%→46% (12/26 tasks). Next: Continue cloud-only development, monitor for failures over 1 week.","impact":"high","shared":false,"synced_to_graph":true}

Crystallized core differentiator through TASK-013 conversation: Legacy tools (Jira, Linear) are human-centric status tracking - AI must infer action from task lists. Ginko provides AI-centric cognitive scaffolding - explicit guidance through semantic relationships (NEXT_TASK, MUST_FOLLOW, MODIFIES, AVOID_GOTCHA). Quantified impact: 5-7x faster session start, 10-20x fewer tokens, 10x less rework, 95% less duplicate work, 300x faster onboarding. Market positioning: 'Jira reports to humans, Ginko works with AI.' This reframes project management for AI-native development. Strategic insight locked in as foundational principle.","files":[".ginko/sessions/chris-at-watchhill-ai/current-events.jsonl",".ginko/sessions/chris-at-watchhill-ai/current-session-log.md"],"impact":"high","shared":false,"synced_to_graph":true}

Root cause: EPIC-002 (AI-Native Sprint Graphs) requires graph relationships for cognitive scaffolding, not text parsing. Original Sprint 1 (team activity feed, patterns display) would need 14-18h rework. Solution: Revised all 4 sprints to build graph infrastructure first - Sprint→Task, Task→File, Task→Event, Epic→Problem relationships. Impact: Zero rework for EPIC-002, direct foundation for 5-10x AI productivity improvements. Created new Sprint 1 plan (SPRINT-2025-12-graph-infrastructure.md) focused on Tier 1 relationships.","files":[".ginko/sessions/chris-at-watchhill-ai/current-session-log.md","docs/epics/EPIC-001-strategic-context-and-dynamic-adaptivity.md","docs/sprints/CURRENT-SPRINT.md"],"impact":"high","shared":false,"synced_to_graph":true}
