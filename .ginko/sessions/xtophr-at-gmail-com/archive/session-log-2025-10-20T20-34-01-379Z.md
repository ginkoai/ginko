# Session Log: session-2025-10-03T19-43-27-939Z

## Timeline
<!-- Chronological log of all session events -->

### 15:43 - [feature]
Enabled session logging for current session by manually creating log file. ADR-033 implementation complete and functional.
Files: .ginko/sessions/xtophr-at-gmail-com/current-session-log.md
Impact: high | Pressure: 19%

### 15:47 - [fix]
Investigated why session log wasn't auto-created on `ginko start`. Root cause: shell persistence - user ran ginko start before ADR-033 was globally installed. Using /clear keeps shell session with cached old binary.
Impact: high | Pressure: 22%

### 15:52 - [decision]
Created FEATURE-032 for shell staleness detection based on /clear usage pattern discovery. Chose Tier 1 (feature detection) as immediate solution with graceful degradation.
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-032.md
Impact: high | Pressure: 25%

### 15:59 - [insight]
Natural language command processing validated: User typed `backlog "Feature Detection"` and AI correctly interpreted as ginko backlog create, enriched with conversation context, and enhanced generic output with actual technical details. Demonstrates FEATURE-021 magic interface pattern working in practice.
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-032.md
Impact: high | Pressure: 28%

### 16:06 - [fix]
Discovered SessionLogger.logEvent() bug: events logged to memory but appendEventToFile() silently fails to write. Manual insertion logic works correctly. Possible fs-extra import issue in transpiled dist code.
Impact: high | Pressure: 29%

### 16:20 - [decision]
Created TASK-004 (critical bug) for SessionLogger.logEvent() file write failure. Root cause analysis points to fs-extra import issue in transpiled dist code. Proposed fix: switch to native fs/promises with explicit error handling.
Files: backlog/items/TASK-004.md
Impact: critical | Pressure: 31%

### 16:28 - [insight]
Critical architectural gap discovered: PressureMonitor always reports 0% but actual Claude Code context is 75%. No integration between ginko CLI and Claude /context token tracking. All ADR-033 pressure measurements are broken.
Impact: critical | Pressure: 75%

### 16:35 - [decision]
Created FEATURE-033 for real context pressure integration. Chose hook-based approach (Option 1) as simplest: Claude Code hook exports GINKO_TOKENS_USED env var, ginko CLI reads on startup and calls PressureMonitor.updateEstimatedTokens().
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-033.md
Impact: critical | Pressure: 76%

### 18:41 - [fix]
Fixed TASK-004 by implementing ginko log command
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/log.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
Impact: high


### 18:41 - [fix]
Fixed TASK-004 by implementing ginko log command
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/log.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
Impact: high


### 18:41 - [achievement]
Completed TASK-004 fix and validated end-to-end session logging works
Impact: high


### 18:43 - [git]
Committed TASK-004 fix and backlog cleanup (d56466f)
Impact: high


### 14:02 - [git]
Committed CLAUDE.md documentation updates (d960708). Added Defensive Logging reflex, quality-focused examples, and CLI-based autonomous logging instructions.
Impact: high


### 16:17 - [feature]
Implemented session synthesis engine with progressive fail-safe (log→handoff→git→status tiers). Architecture shift: synthesize at START from logs (not at END with handoffs). Coffee break test enabled.
Files: packages/cli/src/utils/synthesis.ts:1-600
Impact: high


### 16:17 - [feature]
Implemented session synthesis engine with progressive fail-safe (log→handoff→git→status tiers). Architecture shift: synthesize at START from logs (not at END with handoffs). Coffee break test enabled.
Files: packages/cli/src/utils/synthesis.ts:1-600
Impact: high


### 16:20 - [feature]
Integrated synthesis engine into ginko start command. Displays flow state (1-10), work performed, sprint progress, resume point with actionable next step. Auto-archives stale sessions (>48h or >50 entries).
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/start/start-reflection.ts:50-329, packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts:373-421

### 16:28 - [fix]
Fixed duplication bug - fix/feature now go to Timeline only, git/achievement go to both specific section AND Timeline
Files: packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts:145-200
Impact: high

Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-033.md
Impact: critical | Pressure: 76%

### 14:02 - [decision]
Enhanced CLAUDE.md with Defensive Logging reflex and quality standards. Decision: Prioritize context-rich logging (WHAT+WHY+HOW) over terse labels to enable effective session handoffs for fresh AI. Trade-off: slightly longer log entries vs significantly better context continuity.
Files: CLAUDE.md:95-124, CLAUDE.md:726-773
Impact: high


### 16:18 - [decision]
Documented session synthesis architecture in ADR-036. Key decisions: current.md deprecated, handoff optional, synthesize at START not END, 1-10 flow state matching, progressive fail-safe tiers
Files: docs/adr/ADR-036-session-synthesis-architecture.md
Impact: high
