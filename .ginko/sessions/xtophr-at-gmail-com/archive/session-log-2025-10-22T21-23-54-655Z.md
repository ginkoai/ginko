# Session Log: session-2025-10-22T20-18-52-775Z

## Timeline
<!-- Chronological log of all session events (fixes, features) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 16:20 - [git]
Committed and pushed TASK-009 and TASK-013 implementation (cc5e34b). Major deliverables: two-tier config system with ginko.json + local.json (334 lines, 31/31 tests), session log quality enhancements with interactive prompts (358 lines, 21/21 tests), ADR-033 Addendum 2, and .ginko migration to project root. 57 files changed, 11,387 insertions.
Impact: high


### 17:21 - [achievement]
Updated ADR-033 Addendum 2 with refined understanding distinguishing synthesis (remove) from categorical access (keep). Added comprehensive narrative coherence example showing how dual-routing preserves causality across 8 timeline entries. Documents 4 key principles for pure capture philosophy.
Files: docs/adr/ADR-033-context-pressure-mitigation-strategy.md:574-685
Impact: high


### 17:21 - [achievement]
Updated TASK-014 documentation to reflect enhanced dual-routing approach. Modified acceptance criteria to verify decision/insight/git appear in BOTH their categorical section AND Timeline. Updated technical implementation examples showing dual-routing condition.
Files: backlog/items/TASK-014.md
Impact: medium


### 17:21 - [achievement]
Removed Achievements and Files Affected sections from session log template, updated routing logic to preserve dual-routing for categorized entries. Template now has 4 sections with clear comments about dual-routing. Routing condition: ['decision', 'insight', 'git'].includes(entry.category). Achievement category routes to Timeline only (no duplication).
Files: packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts
Impact: high


### 17:21 - [achievement]
All 25/25 session-log-manager tests passing. TASK-014 implementation complete with comprehensive test coverage validating: (1) Template has 4 sections only, (2) Dual-routing works for decision/insight/git entries, (3) Achievement routes to Timeline only without duplication, (4) Archive, load, and lifecycle operations work correctly. Test progression: 0/25 → 16/25 → 24/25 → 25/25 as infrastructure issues resolved.

Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Files Affected

<!-- Files modified during session (auto-detected from git status) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

### 17:21 - [insight]
Discovered pre-existing test infrastructure issues in session-log-manager.test.ts. Root cause: Tests written for different API signature - expected createSessionLog(user, branch) with 2 params, actual implementation requires createSessionLog(userDir, user, branch) with 3 params. Tests expected return value (logPath), actual returns void. Tests used instance methods but SessionLogManager is purely static. Tests included invalid context_pressure field not in LogEntry type. Evidence suggests tests were never updated after API changes or never ran successfully.

### 17:22 - [decision]
Chose to preserve dual-routing for categorized entries (decision/insight/git) vs Timeline-only approach. Rationale: Dual-routing enables both narrative coherence (Timeline shows complete story) and quick reference (categorical sections scan 5 entries vs 50). Alternatives considered: (1) Timeline-only with tags - simpler but loses scannability, (2) Remove all sections - maximum simplicity but breaks access patterns. Decision made after collaborative discussion with Chris about synthesis vs categorical access distinction.

### 17:22 - [fix]
Fixed 25 failing tests to match SessionLogManager static API. Root cause: Tests written for different API signature (instance methods vs static, wrong params, invalid fields). Solution: (1) Removed manager instance, call static methods directly, (2) Updated createSessionLog calls to include userDir as first param, (3) Removed invalid context_pressure fields, (4) Updated file paths from session.log.md to current-session-log.md, (5) Fixed return type expectations. Systematic sed replacements used for efficiency.

Impact: high


### 17:22 - [fix]
Fixed createSessionLog missing directory creation causing ENOENT errors. Root cause: createSessionLog wrote file directly without ensuring parent directory exists. Solution: Added fs.mkdir(userDir, { recursive: true }) before writeFile. This fixed 9 failing tests that couldn't create session logs in non-existent directories.
