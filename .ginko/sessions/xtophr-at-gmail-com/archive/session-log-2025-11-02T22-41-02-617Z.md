# Session Log: session-2025-11-01T01-39-15-517Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 21:45 - [insight]
Test after inquirer update
Impact: medium


### 21:52 - [achievement]
Successfully migrated from inquirer to prompts library
Impact: high


### 21:52 - [fix]
Migrated from inquirer v9 to prompts v2.4 library to fix Node.js v24 readline compatibility issue. Root cause: inquirer v9 has known readline interface closure bug with Node.js v24+. Solution: Replaced all inquirer.prompt() calls with prompts() across 3 files (log.ts, graph/init.ts, backlog/create.ts). Changed API: 'default' → 'initial', 'list' → 'select', 'input' → 'text'. Build successful, all tests passing.
Files: packages/cli/package.json, packages/cli/src/commands/log.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/graph/init.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/backlog/create.ts
Impact: high


### 21:55 - [achievement]
Final verification test after CLI rebuild and reinstall
Impact: medium


### 21:59 - [git]
Pushed 22 commits to origin/feature/sprint-2025-10-27-cloud-graph including readline bug fix (0728b55), Hetzner Neo4j infrastructure deployment (88fa1a9), and cloud-first knowledge graph foundation work. Branch now synchronized with remote for team collaboration.
Impact: high


### 17:18 - [feature]
Implemented WriteDispatcher system per ADR-041 enabling dual-write migration strategy. Problem: Need safe cutover from local files to cloud graph without data loss. Solution: Adapter pattern routes writes to both graph (primary) and local (secondary) during migration. All TypeScript compilation verified.
Files: src/write-dispatcher.ts, src/adapters/graph-adapter.ts, src/adapters/local-adapter.ts, packages/cli/src/utils/dispatcher-logger.ts
Impact: high


### 17:24 - [feature]
Testing WriteDispatcher integration - local mode only
Impact: medium


### 17:26 - [feature]
Testing graph adapter with fallback to local
Impact: medium


### 17:40 - [achievement]
Updated SPRINT-2025-10-27 with WriteDispatcher completion status and full graph testing steps. Documented 4 completed components (WriteDispatcher, GraphAdapter, LocalAdapter, CLI integration) and 5-step deployment plan for production testing.

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

### 21:45 - [insight]
