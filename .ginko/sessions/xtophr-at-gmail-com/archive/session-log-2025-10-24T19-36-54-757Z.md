# Session Log: session-2025-10-24T17-05-32-740Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 13:53 - [feature]
Implemented real-time insight promotion feature in ginko log command
Impact: high


### 14:29 - [achievement]
Implemented TASK-016: Real-time insight promotion in ginko log. Detects high-impact insights (categories: insight/decision, keywords: discovered/profound/brilliant/game-changer) and prompts to create context modules instantly at low pressure. Uses existing ModuleGenerator service for quality-controlled module creation.
Impact: high


### 15:22 - [insight]
Discovered profound architectural insight: Graph-based context discovery with GraphQL query interface. Enables AI to intelligently discover relevant modules (e.g., ADR-038 when working on UI) while maintaining git-native fallback. In-memory graph for speed, files remain source of truth. Privacy-first, no external dependencies.
Files: packages/cli/src/utils/context-loader.ts
Impact: high


### 15:26 - [achievement]
Created ADR-039: Graph-Based Context Discovery System. Documents in-memory graph + GraphQL query interface architecture for intelligent module discovery. Enables AI to find relevant context (e.g., ADR-038 when working on UI) through flexible queries while maintaining git-native fallback. Includes implementation plan, alternatives analysis, and relevance scoring algorithm.
Files: docs/adr/ADR-039-graph-based-context-discovery.md
Impact: high


### 15:26 - [insight]
Profound architectural insight: Expand graph to ALL knowledge items (PRDs, ADRs, Backlog, Sprints, Context, Sessions). Creates unified knowledge graph enabling queries like 'show backlog items implementing ADR-038' or 'PRDs requiring authentication patterns'. Breaks down silos between documentation systems.
Impact: high


### 15:29 - [achievement]
Session achievements: Implemented TASK-016 (real-time insight promotion in ginko log with ModuleGenerator integration). Created ADR-039 (Unified Knowledge Graph architecture - expanded from context-only to ALL knowledge types: ADRs, PRDs, Backlog, Sprints, Sessions). Committed and pushed both deliverables. Key insight: Graph + GraphQL + git-native enables intelligent discovery while maintaining privacy-first principles.
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->
