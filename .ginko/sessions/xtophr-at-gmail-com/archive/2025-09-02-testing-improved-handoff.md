# Session Handoff

## 📊 Session Summary
Cursor integration complete with full install/uninstall cycle - CLI --apply flag, uninstall command, VS Code extension commands, and hybrid approach working perfectly

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Implemented CLI --apply flag** for permanent Cursor setup (writes .cursorrules to repo root, updates .gitignore, commits changes)
- **Added uninstall-cursor command** with --force and --revert-commit options for clean removal
- **Extended VS Code extension** with Initialize Cursor and Uninstall Cursor commands
- **Tested full install/uninstall/reinstall cycle** proving system robustness
- **Preserved team knowledge** during uninstall (sessions, context, best practices)

## 🔄 Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 1 (.gitignore updated)
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 2 (packages/cli/.ginko/, modified uninstall-cursor.ts)

### Changes Overview
Major CLI and extension enhancements adding Cursor integration lifecycle management. Created init-cursor and uninstall-cursor commands with preview/apply modes. Extended VS Code extension with setup wizard and removal commands. All changes tested end-to-end with successful install/uninstall cycles.

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **Hybrid approach**: CLI automation + VS Code extension UX for best developer experience
- **Non-destructive preview**: --preview flag generates files under .ginko/generated/ only
- **Permanent setup**: --apply flag writes to repo root and commits changes
- **Knowledge preservation**: Uninstall removes integration files but preserves sessions/context
- **Git integration**: Uninstall can optionally revert the integration commit

## 🚧 In Progress
- CLI and extension changes committed but need final cleanup
- .gitignore shows modified state from integration setup
- Uninstall-cursor.ts has minor modifications pending

## 📝 Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- None - full install/uninstall cycle tested and working
- Git commit messages may duplicate if reinstall after revert

### Dependencies
- No new runtime dependencies
- VS Code extension requires @types/vscode and @types/node
- CLI uses fs-extra, ora, chalk for file operations and UX

### Next Steps
1. **Commit final changes** (.gitignore, uninstall-cursor.ts modifications)
2. **Publish VS Code extension** to marketplace with new commands
3. **Create demo video** showing the full install/uninstall cycle
4. **Add Cursor setup to main README** with quick-start instructions
5. **Test cross-IDE compatibility** (Continue.dev, Windsurf)

## 📁 Key Files Modified

### Core Changes
-  - New CLI command with --preview/--apply modes
-  - Uninstall command with git revert support
-  - Registered new commands in CLI
-  - Added Initialize/Uninstall Cursor commands
-  - Extended command palette and activation events

### Supporting Changes
-  - Generated Cursor Custom Mode rules
-  - Setup preview files and instructions
-  - Updated to exclude .ginko/config.json

## 🧠 Mental Model
Focused on complete user lifecycle management for Cursor integration. Built install/uninstall as first-class features rather than afterthoughts. Preserved team knowledge during removal while enabling clean experimentation. Used hybrid CLI+extension approach to meet developers where they work. Prioritized working solutions over theoretical perfection.
