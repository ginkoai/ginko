# Session Log: session-2025-11-04T15-49-13-891Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 11:41 - [feature]
Implemented ADR-043 session cursor management with create/resume/update/find/list operations. Updated ginko start to auto-detect branch and create/resume cursors, added ginko handoff command to pause sessions without synthesis, and enhanced ginko status --all to display all cursors. Includes comprehensive test suite covering cursor lifecycle and multi-cursor support.
Files: packages/cli/src/lib/session-cursor.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/start/start-reflection.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/handoff.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts, packages/cli/test/session-cursor.test.ts
Impact: high


### 11:43 - [feature]
Implemented ADR-043 event-based context loading system. Created context-loader-events.ts with cursor-based event reading, team event filtering, document extraction from events, and graph relationship traversal. Includes integration guide, comparison test suite, and migration documentation.
Problem: Replaces expensive handoff synthesis (88K tokens) with continuous event stream reading (<30K tokens), eliminating context pressure at session boundaries and enabling seamless work continuity
Files: packages/cli/src/lib/context-loader-events.ts
Impact: high


### 11:43 - [feature]
Test event 1 - dual-write validation
Impact: medium


### 11:45 - [feature]
Test event 
Impact: medium


### 11:47 - [feature]
Test event 1
Impact: high


### 11:49 - [fix]
Test event 2
Impact: medium


### 11:51 - [insight]
Test shared event
Impact: medium


### 11:54 - [achievement]
Implemented ADR-043 event logging dual-write system with local JSONL persistence and async Neo4j queue. System tested with 11 events, verified offline mode, and confirmed graceful degradation. All deliverables complete.
Impact: high


### 11:58 - [achievement]
TASK-023.5 Event Stream Implementation Complete: Neo4j schema with multi-tenant isolation, dual-write event logger, session cursor management, and event-based context loading. All 4 agents completed successfully in parallel.
Files: scripts/create-event-stream-schema.ts, packages/cli/src/lib/event-logger.ts, packages/cli/src/lib/event-queue.ts, packages/cli/src/lib/session-cursor.ts, packages/cli/src/lib/context-loader-events.ts
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

### 11:51 - [insight]
Test shared event
Impact: medium


## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
