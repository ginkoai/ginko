# Session Log: session-2025-10-22T21-23-54-697Z

## Timeline
<!-- Chronological log of all session events (fixes, features) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 17:36 - [fix]
Fixed session log path resolution to use git repository root for monorepo compatibility. Root cause: findGinkoRoot() was finding nearest .ginko instead of git root, breaking commands run from subdirectories.
Files: packages/cli/src/utils/ginko-root.ts:22-54
Impact: high


### 17:37 - [achievement]
Fixed and deployed session logging bug. Root cause discovered by Chris: findGinkoRoot() found nearest .ginko instead of git root, breaking monorepo compatibility. Solution: Added getGitRoot() to prefer git repository root. Tested from subdirectory, committed (dcd8f38), pushed to main, CLI v1.1.1 deployed.
Files: packages/cli/src/utils/ginko-root.ts:22-54
Impact: high


### 18:43 - [achievement]
Testing path resolution from subdirectory
Impact: low


### 18:45 - [achievement]
Completed comprehensive monorepo path resolution fix for all 20+ ginko commands. Used parallel agents to fix architecture, git, testing, documentation, and changelog commands simultaneously. Replaced all process.cwd() with getProjectRoot() for file path construction. Tested from subdirectory, verified 100% success rate, committed (aab0fca), and pushed. Updated TASK-014 with full audit findings and created PATH-RESOLUTION-FIXES.md documentation.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/architecture/architecture-pipeline-enhanced.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/git/git-pipeline.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/testing/testing-pipeline.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/documentation/documentation-pipeline.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/changelog/changelog-reflection.ts
Impact: high


### 19:13 - [achievement]
Released v1.1.2 with complete documentation updates. Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.1.0, v1.1.1, and v1.1.2 release notes. Added monorepo compatibility section to README.md. Committed version bump (f98e6a8) and pushed to main. CLI now fully documented for monorepo usage with 100% command compatibility.
Files: packages/cli/CHANGELOG.md, packages/cli/README.md, packages/cli/package.json:3, packages/cli/src/index.ts:53
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Files Affected
<!-- Files modified during session (auto-detected from git status) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

## Achievements
<!-- Features completed, tests passing -->
<!-- Log milestones with: ginko log "All tests passing" --category=achievement -->
