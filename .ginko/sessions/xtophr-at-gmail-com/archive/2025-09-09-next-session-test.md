# Session Handoff

## üìä Session Summary
Completed comprehensive monetization architecture design for Ginko, establishing a git-native, privacy-first platform strategy with three-tier pricing, intelligent AI routing, and community marketplace.

## üéØ Key Achievements
- **Designed complete monetization strategy** - Created 10 PRDs covering pricing, architecture, marketplace, and go-to-market plans
- **Established intelligent model routing** - Achieved 51% cost reduction through multi-model AI approach (ADR-026)
- **Created visualization marketplace design** - Platform economics with 70/30 revenue split for community creators
- **Developed privacy-first AI solution** - Ginko Basic AI for solo developers without API keys
- **Captured session insights** - Created 6 lasting context cards for critical learnings
- **Added enhanced handoff to backlog** - CRITICAL priority feature for automatic context capture

## üîÑ Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 0
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 0
- All changes committed

### Changes Overview
Created comprehensive documentation architecture for monetization including 2 ADRs, 11 PRDs, 6 context modules, and a Q1 2025 sprint plan. All strategic decisions documented and committed.

## üí° Technical Decisions
- **Git-native philosophy** - All user data stays in git, zero vendor lock-in
- **Customer API keys default** - 90%+ margins by avoiding AI inference costs
- **Hybrid AI routing** - Use cheapest appropriate model for each query type
- **Platform over product** - Marketplace creates network effects and recurring revenue
- **/month sweet spot** - 41% cheaper than Jira Premium with better AI features

## üöß In Progress
- No work currently in progress
- All documentation completed and committed
- Ready for next session on FEATURE-018 implementation

## üìù Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- Implementation complexity for 12-week build
- Need to prioritize MVP features carefully
- Market education required for git-native approach

### Dependencies
- Stripe account needed for billing
- Multiple AI provider API keys for routing
- Vercel/Supabase Pro tiers for production

### Next Steps
1. **Create technical architecture for FEATURE-018** - Enhanced Handoff with Automatic Context Capture
2. **Design implementation plan** - Break down into specific tasks and phases
3. **Build prototype** - Test automatic insight extraction from sessions

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

### Core Changes
- docs/adr/ADR-027-monetization-architecture.md - Overall monetization strategy (Adopted)
- docs/adr/ADR-026-intelligent-model-routing.md - AI cost optimization approach
- docs/PRD/monetization-strategy-2025.md - Complete monetization PRD
- docs/PRD/enhanced-handoff-with-auto-capture.md - New CRITICAL feature design
- BACKLOG.md - Added FEATURE-018 as top priority

### Supporting Changes
- docs/PRD/*.md - 11 comprehensive PRDs for all aspects
- .ginko/context/modules/*.md - 6 context cards with lasting insights
- docs/sprints/SPRINT-2025-Q1-monetization-platform.md - 12-week implementation plan
- dashboard/README.md - Added monetization roadmap

## üß† Mental Model
This session transformed Ginko from a tool concept into a platform strategy. The key insight: by NOT storing user data and NOT charging for AI inference, we achieve higher margins and better user trust than competitors. The automatic context capture feature discovered at session end could be the most valuable innovation - ensuring learning compounds rather than evaporates.

## üîê Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. AI enhancement happens on your local machine.
