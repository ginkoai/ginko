# Session Log: session-2025-10-03T19-43-27-939Z

## Timeline
<!-- Chronological log of all session events -->

### 15:43 - [feature]
Enabled session logging for current session by manually creating log file. ADR-033 implementation complete and functional.
Files: .ginko/sessions/xtophr-at-gmail-com/current-session-log.md
Impact: high | Pressure: 19%

### 15:47 - [fix]
Investigated why session log wasn't auto-created on `ginko start`. Root cause: shell persistence - user ran ginko start before ADR-033 was globally installed. Using /clear keeps shell session with cached old binary.
Impact: high | Pressure: 22%

### 15:52 - [decision]
Created FEATURE-032 for shell staleness detection based on /clear usage pattern discovery. Chose Tier 1 (feature detection) as immediate solution with graceful degradation.
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-032.md
Impact: high | Pressure: 25%

### 15:59 - [insight]
Natural language command processing validated: User typed `backlog "Feature Detection"` and AI correctly interpreted as ginko backlog create, enriched with conversation context, and enhanced generic output with actual technical details. Demonstrates FEATURE-021 magic interface pattern working in practice.
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-032.md
Impact: high | Pressure: 28%

### 16:06 - [fix]
Discovered SessionLogger.logEvent() bug: events logged to memory but appendEventToFile() silently fails to write. Manual insertion logic works correctly. Possible fs-extra import issue in transpiled dist code.
Impact: high | Pressure: 29%

### 16:20 - [decision]
Created TASK-004 (critical bug) for SessionLogger.logEvent() file write failure. Root cause analysis points to fs-extra import issue in transpiled dist code. Proposed fix: switch to native fs/promises with explicit error handling.
Files: backlog/items/TASK-004.md
Impact: critical | Pressure: 31%

### 16:28 - [insight]
Critical architectural gap discovered: PressureMonitor always reports 0% but actual Claude Code context is 75%. No integration between ginko CLI and Claude /context token tracking. All ADR-033 pressure measurements are broken.
Impact: critical | Pressure: 75%

### 16:35 - [decision]
Created FEATURE-033 for real context pressure integration. Chose hook-based approach (Option 1) as simplest: Claude Code hook exports GINKO_TOKENS_USED env var, ginko CLI reads on startup and calls PressureMonitor.updateEstimatedTokens().
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-033.md
Impact: critical | Pressure: 76%

### 11:52 - [session-end]
Session ended via handoff: Next session: continue testing handoff generation quality. Fix TypeScript compilation errors in reflector commands
Impact: high
