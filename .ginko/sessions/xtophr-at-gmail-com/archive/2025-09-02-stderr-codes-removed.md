# Session Handoff

## 📊 Session Summary
Handoff workflow improvements complete - Fixed MCP regression, ready for command template improvements

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Implemented smart archive naming** with YYYY-MM-DD-three-word-desc.md format and collision prevention
- **Added AI model self-identification** in frontmatter (model, version, provider) for tracking
- **Fixed MCP tool regression** in /handoff command template - updated to use git-native ginko CLI
- **Added context continuity** - AI reads previous handoff to maintain session flow
- **GitHub Copilot integration** complete with init/uninstall commands and VS Code support

## 🔄 Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 1 (.claude/commands/handoff.md)
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 0

### Changes Overview
Updated the /handoff command template to use git-native ginko CLI instead of deprecated MCP tools (prepare_handoff, store_handoff). This fixes the regression where Claude was trying to use non-existent MCP tools.

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **Deprecated MCP handoff tools** in favor of git-native ginko CLI approach
- **Preserved MCP scoring tools** as optional for when available
- **Archive naming strategy** uses 3-word descriptions from message text
- **AI model tracking** enables comparison across different AI assistants

## 🚧 In Progress
- Command template system needs comprehensive review for other deprecated MCP references
- Testing of new handoff workflow with AI enhancement is complete and working

## 📝 Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- MCP tools still appear in context but many are deprecated - need cleanup
- Command templates may have other references to deprecated MCP tools

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- ginko CLI must be installed globally via npm

### Next Steps
1. **Review all command templates** for deprecated MCP tool references
2. **Create command template improvements** to modernize all templates
3. **Document git-native vs MCP approach** clearly in CLAUDE.md
4. **Test seamless switching** between Cursor, Copilot, and Claude Code

## 📁 Key Files Modified

### Core Changes
- packages/cli/src/commands/handoff-ai.ts - Archive naming, AI model tracking, context loading
- .claude/commands/handoff.md - Fixed MCP regression, updated to ginko CLI

### Supporting Changes
- README.md - Added 'Nothing special, just quicker' tagline
- docs/HANDOFF-IMPROVEMENTS.md - Documented new handoff architecture

## 🧠 Mental Model
Shifted from MCP-centric to git-native approach. Handoffs are now simple markdown files with smart naming, preserved in git history. Each AI assistant self-identifies for tracking. The system maintains perfect continuity by reading previous handoffs. True to Ginko philosophy: automating what developers would do manually, just quicker.

## 🔐 Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. AI enhancement happens on your local machine.
