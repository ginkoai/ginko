# Session Log: session-2025-11-03T23-04-32-412Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 18:10 - [insight]
Analyzed SIMILAR_TO relationship quality in Hetzner Neo4j graph. Found 1,840 SIMILAR_TO relationships (97.3% of total) with significant quality variation: 205 excellent (0.85+), 667 high (0.75-0.85), 48 moderate (0.65-0.75), and likely ~920 below threshold. Discovered duplicate relationship creation bug inflating counts. Only 52 typed relationships (IMPLEMENTS, REFERENCES, SUPERSEDES) which provide much higher value.

Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->
