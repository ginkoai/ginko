# Session Handoff

## üìä Session Summary
Next session: test and refine FEATURE-018 - Automatic context capture with quality control and deduplication

## üéØ Key Achievements
- **Implemented FEATURE-018 prototype** - Complete automatic insight extraction system with SessionCollector, InsightExtractor, and ModuleGenerator
- **Added sophisticated quality control** - Multi-dimensional scoring (clarity, specificity, actionability) with 0.65 minimum threshold
- **Built semantic deduplication** - 75% similarity detection with distinction analysis for meaningful variants
- **Designed context reference strategy** - Primary loading at ginko start, handoff integration, and error-triggered surfacing
- **Created comprehensive architecture docs** - Technical design, sprint plan, and reference strategy documentation

## üîÑ Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 0
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 1
- All changes committed (2 major feature commits)

### Changes Overview
Built complete automatic context capture system with quality controls, adding 7 new TypeScript modules (~3000 lines) and 3 architecture documents. System now intelligently filters, deduplicates, and generates context modules from session insights.

## üí° Technical Decisions
- **Quality over quantity** - Better to skip low-quality insights than pollute knowledge base
- **Distinction with difference** - Allow similar modules when meaningfully different (variants, alternatives, refinements)
- **Zero-friction principle** - Capture happens during natural handoff pause
- **Semantic similarity** - Multi-dimensional comparison across title, problem, solution, tags, and code
- **Git-native storage** - All modules stored as markdown in .ginko/context/modules/

## üöß In Progress
- Ready for integration testing with real session data
- Need to connect to actual AI providers (currently using mock data)
- CLI command registration pending
- User acceptance testing required

## üìù Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- Mock AI responses in InsightExtractor - needs real AI integration
- GenerationResult type not imported in enhanced handoff command
- No actual ginko CLI binary integration yet
- Test coverage not implemented

### Dependencies
- simple-git for repository analysis
- fs-extra for file operations
- chalk and ora for CLI output
- uuid for insight IDs
- AI provider SDKs (not yet integrated)

### Next Steps
1. **Integration testing** - Test with real git repositories and session data
2. **AI provider connection** - Wire up Claude/OpenAI for actual insight extraction
3. **CLI registration** - Add handoff-enhanced command to ginko CLI
4. **Write unit tests** - Cover quality controller and deduplication logic
5. **User testing** - Validate quality thresholds and similarity detection

## üß† Mental Model
This session built the intelligence layer for Ginko's learning system. The key insight: quality control and semantic deduplication are essential for sustainable knowledge management. By filtering trivial insights and detecting meaningful distinctions between similar patterns, the system creates a high-signal knowledge base that improves rather than degrades over time. The automatic capture during handoffs ensures learning compounds without interrupting flow.

## üîê Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. AI enhancement happens on your local machine.
