# Session Handoff

## 📊 Session Summary
STDERR codes removed. Next Session: Command Template System Improvements

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Fixed stderr output regression** - Changed all AI-enhanced commands to use exit code 0
- **Updated handoff command template** - Removed deprecated MCP tool references, now uses git-native ginko CLI
- **Improved error handling** - AI enhancement prompts no longer appear as errors
- **Deprecated special exit codes** - Documented that codes 42-48 should not be used

## 🔄 Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 0
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 0
- All fixes committed and ready

### Changes Overview
Fixed two major regressions: MCP tool references in command templates and stderr output from non-zero exit codes. Updated 8 CLI commands and the handoff template to use proper patterns.

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **Exit code 0 for AI prompts** - Non-zero codes are interpreted as errors by shells
- **Git-native over MCP** - Continue migration away from deprecated MCP tools
- **Command templates need review** - Systematic check required for all templates
- **Keep deprecated code documented** - Helps understand why changes were made

## 🚧 In Progress
- No uncommitted work
- Command template system review pending for next session

## 📝 Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- **MCP tools in context** - Still visible but many are deprecated (confusing)
- **Other command templates** - May have more deprecated MCP references
- **Documentation gap** - Need clear guide on git-native vs MCP approach

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies
- ginko CLI required globally

### Next Steps
1. **Audit all command templates** in .claude/commands/ for deprecated MCP tools
2. **Create migration guide** documenting which tools to use when
3. **Hide/remove deprecated MCP tools** from context to avoid confusion
4. **Test all AI-enhanced commands** to ensure proper output handling

## 🧠 Mental Model
Recognized that shell interpretation of exit codes was causing the stderr issue. Non-zero exit codes signal errors to the shell, regardless of which stream you write to. The fix was simple: use exit code 0 for success. This aligns with Unix philosophy - AI enhancement is the expected successful outcome, not an error condition.

## 🔐 Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. AI enhancement happens on your local machine.
