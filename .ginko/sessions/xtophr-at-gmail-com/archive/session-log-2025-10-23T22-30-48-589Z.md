# Session Log: session-2025-10-23T20-33-41-414Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 18:27 - [achievement]
Completed SPRINT-2025-10-23 Quality & Stability sprint with 53% velocity (8.5/16 SP). Delivered: (1) TASK-006 --quick flag implementation, (2) TASK-007 Phase 1 with 50 ProjectAnalyzer tests achieving 89% coverage, (3) Fixed 2 bugs (backlog exit code, COMPLETION-STATUS filtering), (4) Marked FEATURE-024 complete. Deferred remaining test suites per user decision to prioritize quality over quantity. Key learning: 89% coverage on one critical component provides better production confidence than rushed partial coverage across many components.
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
