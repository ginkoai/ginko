# Session Log: session-2025-10-21T20-50-49-168Z

## Timeline
<!-- Chronological log of all session events -->

### 17:13 - [fix]
Fixed session log archival timing in ginko start. Root cause: session log was archived/reset BEFORE fresh AI could read it for synthesis. Refactored flow to: 1) Read log, 2) Synthesize at low pressure (5-15%), 3) Archive log, 4) Create fresh log. This preserves high-quality defensive logging captured during previous session.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/start/start-reflection.ts:60-82, packages/cli/src/commands/start/index.ts:18-20
Impact: high


### 07:42 - [feature]
Implemented --show flag for ginko log command. Enables users to view current session log in terminal with summary statistics. Makes defensive logging more accessible and transparent during development sessions.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/log.ts:44-71, packages/cli/src/index.ts:95-119
Impact: medium


### 10:15 - [feature]
Created PRD-009: Configuration and Reference System. Defines two-tier config (ginko.json + local.json), reference link system for session→sprint→PRD→ADR navigation, and progressive context loading strategy. Addresses orphaned event problem and enables 80% context from core documents.
Files: docs/PRD/PRD-009-configuration-and-reference-system.md
Impact: high


### 10:27 - [feature]
Created FEATURE-024 with task breakdown: TASK-009 (config foundation), TASK-010 (reference links), TASK-011 (progressive loading), TASK-012 (team collaboration). Complete work breakdown structure for configuration and reference system implementation. (PRD-009, ADR-037)
Files: backlog/items/FEATURE-024-configuration-and-reference-system.md, backlog/items/TASK-009.md, backlog/items/TASK-010.md, backlog/items/TASK-011.md, backlog/items/TASK-012.md
Impact: high


### 10:29 - [feature]
Created SPRINT-2025-10-22-configuration-system with complete 2-week plan: 4 phases, 16 hours effort, success criteria, risk management, and integration points. Sprint implements PRD-009 and ADR-037 for configuration and reference system.
Files: docs/sprints/SPRINT-2025-10-22-configuration-system.md
Impact: high


### 10:31 - [achievement]
Sprint planning complete and ready for execution! Created: PRD-009, ADR-037, FEATURE-024, TASK-009 through TASK-012, SPRINT-2025-10-22. Updated CURRENT-SPRINT.md symlink. All reference links in place. Following our own discipline: PRD→ADR→Backlog→Sprint→Execute. Ready to begin TASK-009.
Files: docs/sprints/CURRENT-SPRINT.md
Impact: high


### 11:02 - [achievement]
Handoff at 80% context pressure after completing comprehensive sprint planning. Session achievements: Fixed session log archival timing (TASK-006), created PRD-009, ADR-037, FEATURE-024, TASK-009-012, SPRINT-2025-10-22. All planning artifacts in place with proper reference links. Next session: Begin TASK-009 execution.
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session -->

### 17:15 - [decision]
Removed 50-entry size restriction from session log auto-archive. Rationale: With new flow archiving on every ginko start, size limit is redundant. 48-hour age limit sufficient for stale session cleanup. No technical reason to limit entry count—defensive logging can safely exceed 50 entries in productive sessions.
Files: packages/cli/src/core/session-log-manager.ts:376-404
Impact: medium


### 10:17 - [decision]
Created ADR-037: Two-Tier Configuration Architecture. Defines team-shared ginko.json (relative paths) + user-specific local.json (absolute paths) to enable instant path resolution, reference navigation, and team collaboration without git conflicts. (PRD-009)
