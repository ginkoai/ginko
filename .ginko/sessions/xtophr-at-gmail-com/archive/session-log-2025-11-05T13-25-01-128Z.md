# Session Log: session-2025-11-04T23-49-14-846Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 18:52 - [achievement]
Completed Unified API Authentication sprint task. Deployed all Graph API endpoints (events, events/team, graph/documents/batch) to app.ginkoai.com unified domain. Converted from Vercel serverless to Next.js App Router format. Updated CLI default URL. Achieved 99% token reduction (93K→500 tokens) with <690ms context load time, exceeding all targets.
Files: dashboard/src/app/api/v1/events/route.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/v1/events/team/route.ts, dashboard/src/app/api/v1/graph/documents/batch/route.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/graph/api-client.ts:146
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
