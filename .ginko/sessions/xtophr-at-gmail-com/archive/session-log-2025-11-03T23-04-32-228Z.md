# Session Log: session-2025-11-03T22-10-05-525Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 17:20 - [insight]
Discovered two parallel Neo4j setups in codebase: 1) Local scripts connect to localhost:7687, 2) CloudGraphClient connects to Hetzner. Need to align which instance to use for batch embedding.
Impact: medium


### 17:28 - [achievement]
Successfully migrated from localhost Neo4j to Hetzner for E2E testing. Loaded 83 docs (59 ADRs, 17 PRDs, 7 Patterns), generated 768d embeddings via all-mpnet-base-v2 model, created vector indexes. Semantic search validated with 64-66% similarity scores. Fixed BigInt conversion issues in CloudGraphClient.getGraphStats().
Files: scripts/load-docs-to-hetzner.ts, scripts/batch-embed-nodes.ts, scripts/create-vector-indexes.ts, api/v1/graph/_cloud-graph-client.ts
Impact: high


### 17:58 - [fix]
Fixed CloudGraphClient.semanticSearch() to work with Graph→CONTAINS structure. Changed from node.graph_id property filter to MATCH (g:Graph)-[:CONTAINS]->(node) pattern. Successfully created 1,892 relationships (1,840 SIMILAR_TO, 40 REFERENCES, 8 IMPLEMENTS, 4 SUPERSEDES). Knowledge graph fully operational on Hetzner.
Files: api/v1/graph/_cloud-graph-client.ts:427-454
Impact: high


### 18:03 - [achievement]
Updated sprint documentation with complete Hetzner E2E migration summary. Documented all 7 accomplishments: CloudGraphClient fixes, migration scripts, 83 docs loaded, embeddings, vector indexes, 1,892 relationships, semantic search validation. Sprint progress: 9/13 deliverables (69%). Committed to git and pushed to remote.

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->
