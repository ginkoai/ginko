# Session Log: session-2025-11-04T14-04-53-793Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 10:19 - [decision]
Created ADR-043: Event Stream Session Model - sessions become read cursors into unbounded event stream, eliminates handoff synthesis, preserves flow state across context resets
Alternatives: ADR-033 handoff synthesis, wait for infinite context windows, hierarchical sessions, snapshot-based continuity
Files: docs/adr/ADR-043-event-stream-session-model.md
Impact: high


### 10:43 - [feature]
Updated ADR-043 with multi-team collaboration section. No architectural changes needed - event stream naturally supports teams through query patterns. Added 5 query patterns for team visibility (my events, team high-signal, branch activity, collision detection, activity feed). Total team context: ~8K tokens vs ~5K solo. Git integration via hooks for bidirectional navigation between commits and ginko events.

Impact: high


### 10:44 - [feature]
Added TASK-023.5 to sprint plan: Session Event Stream Implementation. Critical 10-hour task to implement ADR-043 event stream model with dual-write logging, session cursors, query-based team collaboration, and git integration. Key deliverables: Event/SessionCursor Neo4j schema, dual-write with async sync, context loading from events (solo 5K + team 8K tokens), 5 team query patterns, git hooks for auto-logging. Eliminates handoff synthesis, preserves flow state across context resets.
Files: docs/sprints/SPRINT-2025-10-27-cloud-knowledge-graph.md
Impact: high


### 10:48 - [insight]
Key insight: Sessions are technical artifacts of context window limits, not logical work boundaries. By treating sessions as read cursors into unbounded event streams (like Git's HEAD → commits), we eliminate artificial pressure at boundaries, preserve flow state, and enable query-driven context loading. Multi-team collaboration requires no architectural changes - just different query patterns over the same event stream.
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->
