# Session Log: session-2025-10-28T18-51-38-068Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 15:06 - [achievement]
Neo4j schema fully implemented and tested. All 7 node types (ADR, PRD, Pattern, Gotcha, Session, CodeFile, ContextModule) with 7 constraints and 39 indexes working. Complex graph queries validated in <150ms.
Files: src/graph/neo4j-client.ts, src/graph/schema/
Impact: high


### 15:20 - [achievement]
Completed Neo4j local development phase. Built full schema (7 node types, 39 indexes), loaded 75 documents from repo, validated <100ms context queries. All Week 1 schema goals achieved.
Files: src/graph/
Impact: high


### 15:31 - [achievement]
Completed comprehensive Neo4j implementation review. All tests pass with 10-14x better performance than 100ms target: full-text search 7-10ms, multi-hop queries 19ms, context loading 7-35ms. Schema validated: 7 node types, 7 constraints, 39 indexes. Production data loaded: 41 ADRs, 11 PRDs. Implementation is production-ready.
Files: src/graph/neo4j-client.ts, src/graph/schema/
Impact: high


### 15:42 - [achievement]
Added comprehensive Jest test suite for Neo4j implementation. Created 46 tests across 3 test files covering client operations, schema validation, and query performance. All tests passing with validated sub-100ms query performance. Test setup handles Neo4j Integer type conversion and proper test isolation.

Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
