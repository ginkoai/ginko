# Session Handoff

## üìä Session Summary
Day 3 CLI Polish Complete - Revolutionary context module discovery. Successfully polished Ginko CLI with new commands and discovered game-changing Persistent Context Module System that transforms Ginko from session management to AI memory management.

## ‚úÖ Accomplished This Session

### CLI Polish & Testing
- Created comprehensive test plan for clean-start usage
- Fixed archive naming: `2025-08-27-fix-auth-bug.md` format (human-readable)
- Removed repetitive privacy messages ("lady doth protest too much")
- Tested end-to-end workflow with fresh project

### New Commands Implemented
- **ginko vibecheck** - Quick recalibration when feeling lost
- **ginko compact** - Clean up old sessions and optimize storage
- **ginko ship** - Create and push PR-ready branches with tests

### Revolutionary Discovery: Persistent Context Modules
- **Problem**: AI loses all context between sessions (50%+ tokens wasted on re-learning)
- **Solution**: Modular "memory cards" that persist learnings across sessions
- **Impact**: Could reduce token usage by 50% while increasing velocity
- **Documentation**: ADR-022, FEATURE-017 added to backlog as CRITICAL

## üìÅ Working Files

### Modified
- dashboard/src/app/api/generate-api-key/route.ts
- dashboard/src/app/api/sessions/scorecards/route.ts
- dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
- mcp-client/package.json
- mcp-client/src/statusline/ginko-statusline.cjs
- package-lock.json

## üéØ Work Mode: Configuring

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Implement Context Module System (FEATURE-017)
- Build core module loader in `/packages/cli/src/commands/context-new.ts`
- Create capture workflow for organic context creation
- Implement auto-discovery based on working directory
- Add progressive loading (lazy, proximity-based)

### Priority 2: Alpha Testing
- Test CLI with real users
- Gather feedback on new commands (vibecheck, compact, ship)
- Refine based on usage patterns

### Priority 3: Integration & Polish
- Hook context modules into `ginko start`
- Add extraction during `ginko handoff`
- Create git hooks for automatic updates
- Fix any remaining issues from test plan

## üí° Key Insights from Session

### The Big Discovery
The Persistent Context Module System could be Ginko's killer feature. It solves the fundamental AI problem of context amnesia. Each module acts as a "memory card":
```
.ginko/context/modules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arch-authentication.md      # Architecture knowledge
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config-database.md          # Configuration details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decision-no-typescript.md   # Team decisions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pattern-error-handling.md   # Code patterns
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gotcha-async-hooks.md       # Learned gotchas
```

### What Worked Well
- Breadth-first implementation (all commands first, then depth)
- Test-driven development with fresh project
- Listening to user feedback (archive naming, privacy concerns)

### Technical Decisions Made
- Privacy messages only on init/help (not every command)
- Archive files use `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` format
- Context modules will be git-native (no server storage)
- Progressive loading is essential for token efficiency

## üîê Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. No data was sent to any server.
