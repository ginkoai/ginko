# Session Handoff

## 📊 Session Summary
Fixed Claude CLI installation and removed deprecated MCP tool references

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Fixed broken Claude CLI** - Reinstalled @anthropic-ai/claude-code package v1.0.109, restored executable functionality
- **Completed MCP deprecation cleanup** - Removed all deprecated tool references from documentation
- **Committed all changes** - Documentation updates are now in git with clear commit message

## 🔄 Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 0
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 0
- All changes committed

### Changes Overview
Fixed the Claude CLI installation issue where the executable was missing, then completed the MCP tool deprecation work by committing all documentation updates.

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **Manual cleanup for npm conflicts** - npm uninstall failed due to directory conflicts, resolved by reinstalling over existing installation
- **Documentation-only updates** - Workspace CLAUDE.md files about MCP server/client implementations were left as-is (they're appropriate)
- **Selective temp file cleanup** - Removed only the recent temporary files, kept older ones for history

## 🚧 In Progress
- No work in progress
- All tasks completed and committed

## 📝 Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- **MCP tools still visible** - They come from external ginko-mcp server, documentation now clearly states to use ginko CLI instead
- **Old temp files remain** - .ginko/.temp/ has older files from September 2nd that weren't cleaned (intentionally kept)

### Dependencies
- Claude CLI now at v1.0.109
- ginko CLI required globally
- No new dependencies

### Next Steps
1. **Consider configuration system** - The architecture exploration for making Ginko modular was started but not completed
2. **Monitor Claude CLI stability** - Ensure the reinstalled CLI continues working properly
3. **Update any remaining docs** - If other references to deprecated MCP tools are found

## 📁 Key Files Modified

### Core Changes
- .claude/commands/start.md - Updated to use ginko CLI instead of MCP tools
- CLAUDE.md - Replaced MCP tool listings with git-native patterns, added deprecation notice

### Supporting Changes
- .claude/local/package.json - Updated to @anthropic-ai/claude-code v1.0.109
- .ginko/sessions/ - Session tracking and handoff files

## 🧠 Mental Model
This session was about fixing infrastructure (Claude CLI) and completing cleanup work (MCP deprecation). The approach was methodical: diagnose the issue, fix it, then complete the documentation cleanup that was already in progress. Everything is now in a clean, committed state.
