# Session Handoff

## üìä Session Summary
Cleaned up deprecated MCP tool references from command templates and documentation

## üéØ Key Achievements
- **Removed deprecated MCP tool references** - Updated .claude/commands/start.md to use ginko CLI instead of MCP tools
- **Updated main CLAUDE.md documentation** - Replaced MCP tool listings with git-native filesystem patterns
- **Added deprecation warnings** - Clearly documented that MCP tools are deprecated in favor of ginko CLI
- **Verified AI command output handling** - Tested all AI-enhanced commands properly output to stdout with exit code 0

## üîÑ Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 4 (.claude/commands/start.md, CLAUDE.md, .ginko session files)
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 4 (temporary ginko files)

### Changes Overview
Systematically removed all references to deprecated MCP tools (prepare_handoff, store_handoff, assess_handoff_quality, etc.) from command templates and documentation. Replaced with git-native filesystem operations using the ginko CLI.

## üí° Technical Decisions
- **Git-native over MCP approach** - All context loading now happens via filesystem reads, not MCP server calls
- **Command templates use ginko CLI** - Direct filesystem operations are more reliable and work offline
- **Deprecation notice added** - Clear warning in CLAUDE.md about using ginko CLI instead of MCP tools
- **Maintained backward compatibility** - MCP tools still exist but documentation directs to preferred approach

## üöß In Progress
- No uncommitted functional changes
- Documentation updates ready to commit

## üìù Context for Next Session

### Known Issues
- **MCP tools still visible in context** - They're provided by external ginko-mcp server, can't be hidden directly
- **Some docs still reference MCP** - Found references in evals/, api/, and other workspace-specific CLAUDE.md files
- **No migration guide yet** - Decided to skip for now, focus on direct cleanup

### Dependencies
- ginko CLI required globally
- No new dependencies added

### Next Steps
1. **Commit documentation updates** - Get the cleaned up templates and docs into git
2. **Update workspace-specific CLAUDE.md files** - Remove MCP references from api/, dashboard/, etc.
3. **Consider configuration system** - Explore making ginko more modular via templates (architecture was started)

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

### Core Changes
- .claude/commands/start.md - Replaced MCP context loading with ginko CLI approach
- CLAUDE.md - Removed MCP tool listings, added git-native patterns and deprecation notice

### Supporting Changes
- .ginko/sessions/xtophr-at-gmail-com/current.md - Session tracking updated
- Various temporary ginko files for architecture exploration

## üß† Mental Model
Focused on removing confusion by eliminating deprecated MCP tool references. The git-native approach using ginko CLI is simpler, works offline, and aligns with the project's philosophy of keeping everything in version control. Each command template now directly reads from filesystem rather than making server calls.

## üîê Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. AI enhancement happens on your local machine.
