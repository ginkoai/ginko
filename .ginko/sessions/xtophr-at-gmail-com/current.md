# Enhanced Session Handoff

## 📊 Session Summary
Completed implementation of Git-Native Backlog Management System (FEATURE-020) with full documentation and implementation plan for magic commands.

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Created Git-Native Backlog System**: Replaced 110KB monolithic BACKLOG.md with distributed file system
- **Documentation Complete**: PRD-008, ADR-011 (backlog architecture), ADR-012 (command architecture)
- **Migrated 15 Items**: 10 features, 3 stories, 2 tasks - all under 2KB each
- **Implementation Plan**: FEATURE-021 with complete breakdown into stories and tasks
- **Self-Hosting**: System now tracks its own development

## 🔄 Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Files changed: Multiple backlog items created
- Commits this session: 7 major commits

### System Architecture Established
```

## 💡 Key Insights Captured

### Magic Command Architecture
**Insight**: Three-layer design (Human Intent → Ginko Structure → AI Execution)
**Impact**: Eliminates command syntax learning curve
**Implementation**: Progressive mastery from verbose → shortcuts → pure intent

### Structured Freedom Philosophy
**Insight**: Templates + AI = Consistent outputs with natural input
**Impact**: Best of both worlds - flexibility without chaos
**Documented**: ADR-012 captures full architecture

## 📁 What Was Built

### Documentation
- `docs/PRD-008-git-native-backlog.md` - Product requirements
- `docs/ADR-011-backlog-architecture.md` - Flat file decision
- `docs/ADR-012-ginko-command-architecture.md` - Magic commands

### Backlog Items Created
- `FEATURE-021-ginko-backlog-commands.md` - Implementation plan
- `STORY-001-basic-command-structure.md` - Basic CRUD operations
- `STORY-002-ai-integration-layer.md` - Natural language processing
- `STORY-003-progressive-shortcuts.md` - Aliases and shortcuts
- `TASK-001-setup-command-routing.md` - Infrastructure
- `TASK-002-implement-create-command.md` - Create functionality

## 🚧 Ready to Start
- **TASK-001**: Set up command routing infrastructure
  - Location: `packages/cli/src/commands/backlog/`
  - Pattern: Follow existing command structure
  - First step: Create BacklogCommand base class

## 📝 Context for Next Session

### Implementation Path
1. Start with TASK-001 (command routing)
2. Implement basic CRUD (STORY-001)
3. Add AI layer (STORY-002)
4. Progressive shortcuts (STORY-003)

### Key Design Decisions
- Flat file structure in `backlog/items/`
- Frontmatter for metadata
- Templates guide AI
- Progressive command interface
- Zero-command magic via `ginko "any request"`

### Next Steps
1. Set up command routing (`packages/cli/src/commands/backlog/`)
2. Implement create command with ID generation
3. Test with remaining archive items

## 🧠 Mental Model
This session revealed 1 key insights (gotcha) that will save approximately 60 minutes in future work. The automatic capture ensures these learnings compound rather than evaporate.

## 🔐 Privacy Note
This handoff and all captured insights are stored locally in git. No data is sent to external servers.
