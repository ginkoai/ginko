# Session Handoff

## üìä Session Summary
Next session: Phase 3 - Additional testing and refinement of ADR-026

## üéØ Key Achievements
- **Completed ADR-026 implementation** - Enhanced ginko init with intelligent project optimization
- **Built model-agnostic architecture** - Supports Claude, GPT, and generic AI models via adapter pattern
- **Implemented deep project analysis** - Detects frameworks, patterns, dependencies with --analyze flag
- **Created progressive learning system** - Natural command discovery through contextual hints
- **Added Git-style directory walking** - Commands work from any subdirectory like git
- **Fixed capture command output** - Now properly outputs to stdout instead of stderr

## üîÑ Current State

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified files: 0
- Staged files: 0
- Untracked files: 0

### Changes Overview
Session delivered complete ADR-026 implementation with 15+ new files and 2,500+ lines of TypeScript. Major components include template engine, project analyzers, AI adapters, and progressive learning system. All changes committed and documented.

## üí° Technical Decisions
- **Adapter pattern for AI models** - Clean abstraction allowing easy addition of new AI models
- **Caching for deep analysis** - 1-hour cache to avoid redundant expensive project scans
- **ES modules with .js extensions** - Required for Node.js ESM compatibility
- **Progressive hints stored in user-progress.json** - Tracks command usage and experience level
- **Git-style upward directory search** - findGinkoRoot() walks up tree to find .ginko

## üöß In Progress
- Multi-model support for edge case (Claude for planning, LLaMa for code) - captured as TODO
- Additional test coverage for new components
- Performance optimization for large monorepos

## üìù Context for Next Session
### Known Issues
- Deep analysis might be slow on very large codebases (needs optimization)
- Glob pattern matching needs refinement for complex project structures
- Progressive hints need more user testing for timing/relevance

### Dependencies
- Added 'glob' package for file pattern matching
- No external API dependencies - all analysis is local
- Compatible with Node.js 18+ for ESM support

### Next Steps
1. **Write comprehensive integration tests** for init command with all flags
2. **Add more AI adapters** (Gemini, LLaMa, Mistral)
3. **Optimize deep analysis performance** for large codebases
4. **Create context modules for more frameworks** (Angular, Svelte, Django)
5. **Test progressive learning with real users** and refine hint timing

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

### Core Changes
- packages/cli/src/templates/ai-instructions-template.ts - Model-agnostic template engine
- packages/cli/src/analysis/project-analyzer.ts - Quick project analysis
- packages/cli/src/analysis/deep-analyzer.ts - Comprehensive project scanning
- packages/cli/src/utils/progressive-learning.ts - Hint system for natural discovery
- packages/cli/src/adapters/*.ts - AI model adapters (Claude, GPT, Generic)
- packages/cli/src/utils/ginko-root.ts - Git-style directory walking

### Supporting Changes
- packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts - Enhanced with analysis and model selection
- packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts - Integrated progressive learning
- packages/cli/src/index.ts - Added --analyze and --model flags
- docs/reference/architecture/ADR-026*.md - Documentation and status updates
- docs/SPRINTS/SPRINT-2025-08-28*.md - Sprint planning and tracking

## üß† Mental Model
Focused on creating a seamless onboarding experience that adapts to both the project and the user. The system learns about the project through analysis while simultaneously learning about the user through command tracking. This dual-learning approach enables contextual, timely assistance without being intrusive - following the flow state philosophy from ADR-023.

The adapter pattern ensures future flexibility while the progressive learning ensures users discover features naturally. Everything is local-first and git-native, maintaining the privacy and simplicity principles of ginko.

## üîê Privacy Note
This handoff is stored locally in git. AI enhancement happens on your local machine.
