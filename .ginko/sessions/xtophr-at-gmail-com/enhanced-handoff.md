# Session Handoff - Enhanced

## 📊 Session Summary
**Major Achievement**: Implemented complete Why→What→How development workflow, transforming Ginko from a context capture tool into a comprehensive development philosophy system.

## 🚀 Key Accomplishments

### Philosophy Foundation
1. **ADR-023: Flow State Design Philosophy**
   - Established "done" by default pattern
   - 5-second rule for all commands
   - Silent success to preserve flow
   - Output inversely proportional to importance

2. **ADR-024: AI-Enhanced Local Tooling Pattern**
   - "Nothing special, just quicker" principle
   - CLI→AI→CLI local enrichment loop
   - Two-phase execution model with exit codes
   - 100% privacy-first, local execution

### Command Implementation
3. **Hero Command: `ginko capture`**
   - 2-second context snapshots working
   - AI enhancement via exit code 42
   - Template generation with [AI: ...] placeholders
   - Quick mode (--quick) for non-AI captures

4. **Development Workflow Commands**
   - `ginko explore` → Creates PRDs (exit code 43)
   - `ginko architecture` → Creates ADRs (exit code 44)
   - `ginko plan` → Creates Sprint Plans (exit code 45)
   - Complete traceability: PRD→ADR→Sprint→Captures

### Critical Discoveries
5. **Hybrid Unix Pattern for Actionable Captures**
   - Semantic detection (TODO:, BUG:, FIX:)
   - Unix pipes for power users
   - Avoids "Swiss Army knife" anti-pattern

6. **Template Gaps for New AIs**
   - Missing project context in templates
   - Generic prompts need specificity
   - stderr output creates anxiety (needs fix)
   - No AI context about Ginko itself

## 🎯 Work Mode: Configuring → Building

## 🚨 Critical TODOs for Next Session

### Immediate Fixes (< 30 mins)
1. **Fix stderr→stdout** in explore/architecture/plan (5 mins)
   - Currently outputs to stderr causing "Error:" prefix
   - Simple change from console.error() to console.log()

2. **Add AI Enhancement to Remaining Commands**
   - [ ] `ginko handoff` - Should use exit code 46
   - [ ] `ginko vibecheck` - Should analyze patterns
   - [ ] `ginko status` - Could suggest next actions
   - [ ] `ginko compact` - Could intelligently prune

### Core Implementation (Next Sprint)
3. **Implement Semantic Detection**
   - TODO: prefix → creates backlog item
   - BUG: prefix → creates bug ticket
   - FIX: prefix → links to issue

4. **Add AI Context Blocks**
   - Explain what Ginko is
   - Load project context
   - Reference recent work
   - Auto-discover related docs

5. **Build Context Module Loading**
   - `ginko load [pattern]` command
   - Auto-discovery based on directory
   - Progressive loading (core→expanded→deep)
   - Integration with `ginko start`

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Enterprise Integration Path
- **Role-Based Workflow**: PMs use explore, Architects use architecture, Devs use plan
- **Methodology Agnostic**: Works with SCRUM, Kanban, TOGAF, SAFe
- **Webhook Opportunities**: Message queue integration for actionable items
- **Audit Trail**: Perfect traceability from problem→decision→implementation

### Solo Developer Value
- **Intentional Hat-Switching**: Forces thinking through Why→What→How
- **Prevents Premature Coding**: Explore before building
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Context modules build over time
- **Flow State Preservation**: Everything designed for minimal interruption

## 🔄 Current State Details

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified: 9 files (mostly CLI commands)
- Untracked: 29 files (new commands, docs, context modules)
- **Action Needed**: Commit new ADRs and commands

### Test Coverage Gaps
- No tests for new commands yet
- Need end-to-end workflow tests
- Performance benchmarks needed

### Documentation Status
- ADRs complete and comprehensive
- PRD demonstrates exploration value
- Sprint plan shows concrete tasks
- README needs update with new commands

## 🎯 Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ 2-second captures working
- ✅ AI enhancement pattern proven
- ✅ Complete workflow operational
- ✅ Exit codes properly signaling modes
- ✅ Git-native storage functioning
- ⏳ Semantic detection (not yet implemented)
- ⏳ Auto-loading context (not yet implemented)

## 🔮 Next Session Game Plan

### Hour 1: Quick Fixes
- Fix stderr issue across all commands
- Add AI enhancement to handoff command
- Test with fresh terminal session

### Hour 2: Semantic Detection
- Implement detectActionable() function
- Add backlog creation logic
- Test TODO/BUG prefixes

### Hour 3: Context Loading
- Build ginko load command
- Implement auto-discovery
- Wire into ginko start

### Hour 4: Testing
- End-to-end workflow test
- Test with new AI (not Claude)
- Document gaps found

## 📝 Key Learning
The system has evolved from a simple context capture tool to a complete development philosophy implementation. The Why→What→How workflow isn't just commands - it's a forcing function for better thinking. The AI enhancement pattern (CLI→AI→CLI) creates a perfect balance of automation and control.

**Most Important Discovery**: The templates need to be self-documenting for AIs that haven't built Ginko. Adding context blocks and project awareness will make this work for any AI assistant.

## 🔐 Privacy Note
This enhanced handoff is stored locally in git. No data was sent to any server.
