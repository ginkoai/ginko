# Session Log: session-2025-10-22T23-17-56-068Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 10:18 - [decision]
Retired ginko handoff command completely. Decision: The handoff concept evolved from artifact-based (synthesized current.md) to process-based (continuous logging + synthesis at start). The command became a vestige of old architecture. Context continuity is now handled automatically by session logging + ginko start synthesis. Pre-go-live timing allows clean break without user migration burden. Alternatives: Considered deprecation path, rebranding as utility, expanding scope - all rejected because functionality is redundant with auto-archive and git workflows.
Files: packages/cli/src/commands/handoff/index.ts
Impact: high


### 10:18 - [insight]
Key insight: Hero features can evolve into foundational architecture. What started as a single command (ginko handoff) evolved into a complete architecture (defensive logging + session synthesis). The hero's legacy lives in the system design, not the command. When architecture supersedes feature, retire gracefully and celebrate the evolution. Pattern applies to any feature that becomes infrastructure.
Impact: high


### 10:41 - [achievement]
Retired ginko handoff command completely. Removed 6 handoff-related files and all command registration. Enhanced ginko ship with cleanup (default on) and --docs flag for changelog/sprint verification. Extracted cleanup utility for reuse. Build verified successful.
Files: packages/cli/src/index.ts, packages/cli/src/commands/ship.ts, packages/cli/src/utils/cleanup.ts
Impact: high


### 11:56 - [feature]
Updated ADR-036 with handoff command retirement documentation. Added comprehensive section detailing decision rationale, functionality migration to ginko ship, and the hero feature evolution insight. Completes the narrative arc from handoff-required → handoff-optional → handoff-retired.
Files: docs/adr/ADR-036-session-synthesis-architecture.md:256-307
Impact: medium


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->
