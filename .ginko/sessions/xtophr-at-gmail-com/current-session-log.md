# Session Log: session-2025-10-30T18-08-17-778Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 11:40 - [achievement]
Completed knowledge graph enrichment with cross-type semantic relationships. Extended from 50 to 137 nodes across 6 document types (Sessions, ADRs, Patterns, PRDs, Gotchas, ContextModules). Created 298 total relationships including 11 explicit semantic types (APPLIES_TO, LEARNED_FROM, MITIGATED_BY). Graph now supports powerful queries like 'Which patterns address this gotcha?' and 'Where was this pattern discovered?'
Files: src/graph/scripts/load-extended-documents.ts, src/graph/scripts/create-semantic-relationships.ts, src/graph/scripts/analyze-cross-type-relationships.ts, src/graph/scripts/graph-summary.ts
Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
