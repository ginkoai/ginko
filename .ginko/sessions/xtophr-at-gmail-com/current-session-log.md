# Session Log: session-2025-10-27T16-41-31-514Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 17:18 - [achievement]
Sprint 2025-10-27 launched - Cloud-First Knowledge Graph Platform. Created PRD-010 (comprehensive architecture, freemium business model with OSS free tier, 4-week MVP plan), updated ADR-039 (documented cloud-first pivot), created sprint plan with 9 detailed tasks across 4 weeks. Strategic pivot from file-based to cloud-first SaaS while preserving CLI UX. Committed b8387b8.

Impact: high


## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
