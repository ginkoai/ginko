# Session Log: session-2025-10-22T20-18-52-775Z

## Timeline
<!-- Chronological log of all session events (fixes, features) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Files Affected
<!-- Files modified during session (auto-detected from git status) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->

## Achievements
<!-- Features completed, tests passing -->
<!-- Log milestones with: ginko log "All tests passing" --category=achievement -->
