# Session Log: session-2025-10-28T15-23-40-242Z

## Timeline
<!-- Complete chronological log of all session events -->
<!-- Includes: fixes, features, achievements, and categorized entries (decisions/insights/git also appear in their sections) -->
<!-- GOOD: "Fixed auth timeout. Root cause: bcrypt rounds set to 15 (too slow). Reduced to 11." -->
<!-- BAD: "Fixed timeout" (too terse, missing root cause) -->

### 11:23 - [achievement]
Completed AI-first knowledge graph schema design. Core innovation: optimize for AI context synthesis rather than human browsing. Schema includes 7 node types (ADR, PRD, Pattern, Gotcha, Session, CodeFile, ContextModule) with vector embeddings for semantic search. Key relationships enable fast context loading (<100ms target), cross-project discovery, and temporal knowledge tracking. Designed to give AI pair instant access to institutional knowledge from

⚡ Resume Point:
   Completed TASK-018 research phase. Evaluated 5 graph database options (PostgreSQL+AGE, Neo4j, DGraph, EdgeDB, Neo4j AuraDB). Disqualified 3 options: Apache AGE (incompatible with Supabase PostgreSQL 15), DGraph (multi-tenancy is Enterprise-only), Neo4j AuraDB (too expensive). Narrowed to 2 finalists: Neo4j Community (/mo, battle-tested, excellent docs) vs EdgeDB (/mo, modern TypeScript DX, built-in multi-tenancy). Next: Side-by-side prototyping to compare developer experience and performance. (docs/decisions/graph-db-evaluation.md)

📍 Next Action:

## Key Decisions
<!-- Important decisions made during session with alternatives considered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Chose JWT over sessions. Alternatives: server sessions (harder to scale), OAuth (vendor lock-in). JWT selected for stateless mobile support." -->
<!-- BAD: "Chose JWT for auth" (missing alternatives and rationale) -->

## Insights
<!-- Patterns, gotchas, learnings discovered -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- GOOD: "Discovered bcrypt rounds 10-11 optimal. Testing showed rounds 15 caused 800ms delays; rounds 11 achieved 200ms with acceptable entropy." -->
<!-- BAD: "Bcrypt should be 11" (missing context and discovery process) -->

## Git Operations
<!-- Commits, merges, branch changes -->
<!-- These entries also appear in Timeline for narrative coherence -->
<!-- Log significant commits with: ginko log "Committed feature X" --category=git -->
