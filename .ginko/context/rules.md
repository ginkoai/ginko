# Context Management Rules

## Privacy & Security
- All context stored locally in .ginko/
- No data leaves your machine without explicit action
- Handoffs are git-tracked for team collaboration
- Config (.ginko/config.json) is gitignored

## Best Practices
- Always run `ginko handoff` before switching context
- Use `ginko start` to resume with full context
- Keep handoffs under 2000 words for clarity
- Include specific next steps in every handoff
