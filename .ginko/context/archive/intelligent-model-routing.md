# Intelligent Model Routing - Cost Optimization

## Context
Ginko needs to provide AI insights to solo developers without API keys while maintaining sustainable economics. Single-model approaches are either too expensive or insufficient quality. Our solution: intelligent routing based on query complexity.

## Technical Solution

### Model Distribution Strategy
```yaml
Query Classification:
  Basic (50%): Claude 3 Haiku at $0.0005/request
  Standard (30%): Claude 3.5 Sonnet at $0.006/request
  Complex (15%): Grok at $0.007/request
  Real-time (5%): Grok with web at $0.007/request

Result:
  Average cost: $0.00345/request (51% reduction)
  Monthly cost (10K users): $345 vs $700 single-model
```

### Query Classifier Logic
```typescript
// Automatic complexity detection
if (query.match(/summary|count|total|basic/i)) {
  return QueryComplexity.BASIC;  // → Haiku
}
if (query.match(/analyze|compare|trend/i)) {
  return QueryComplexity.STANDARD;  // → Sonnet
}
if (query.match(/predict|forecast|architecture/i)) {
  return QueryComplexity.COMPLEX;  // → Grok
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Memory**: Recent 100 queries (<1ms)
- **L2 Redis**: Distributed cache (<10ms)
- **L3 S3**: Long-term storage (<100ms)
- **Cache hit rate target**: 30-40%

## Impact
- **51% cost reduction** while maintaining quality
- **Sustainable free tier** at $0.0345/user/month
- **96.5% margins** on Pro tier
- **Sub-second response times** with caching

## Implementation
- Week 1: Basic routing with static weights
- Week 2: ML classifier and dynamic adjustment
- Week 3: Full caching and optimization
- Week 4: Production deployment
