# Launching 5 parallel implementation agents for Sprint 3: ...

**Type**: decision  
**Tags**: decision, high  
**Created**: 2026-01-16  

## Context

Launching 5 parallel implementation agents for Sprint 3: (1) t01 Mobile, (2) t02+t06 Accessibility combined, (3) t03 Presets, (4) t04 Search, (5) t05 Onboarding

## Decision

Launching 5 parallel implementation agents for Sprint 3: (1) t01 Mobile, (2) t02+t06 Accessibility combined, (3) t03 Presets, (4) t04 Search, (5) t05 Onboarding. Combined t02+t06 since both modify tree components for accessibility.

## Rationale

Launching 5 parallel implementation agents for Sprint 3: (1) t01 Mobile, (2) t02+t06 Accessibility combined, (3) t03 Presets, (4) t04 Search, (5) t05 Onboarding. Combined t02+t06 since both modify tree components for accessibility.
