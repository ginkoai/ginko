# Starting TASK-013: Graph Reliability Testing

**Type**: decision  
**Tags**: decision, high, testing  
**Created**: 2025-11-21  

## Context

Starting TASK-013: Graph Reliability Testing

## Decision

Starting TASK-013: Graph Reliability Testing. Goal: Enable cloud-only mode (GINKO_CLOUD_ONLY=true) and test graph operations during development session. Will document all failures, implement retry logic, and achieve 99.9% reliability. This establishes cloud graph as single source of truth, eliminating dual-write complexity.

## Rationale

Starting TASK-013: Graph Reliability Testing. Goal: Enable cloud-only mode (GINKO_CLOUD_ONLY=true) and test graph operations during development session. Will document all failures, implement retry logic, and achieve 99.9% reliability. This establishes cloud graph as single source of truth, eliminating dual-write complexity.
