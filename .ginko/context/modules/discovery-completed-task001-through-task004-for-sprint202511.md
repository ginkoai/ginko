## What Was Discovered

Completed TASK-001 through TASK-004 for SPRINT-2025-11-18

## Value

Completed TASK-001 through TASK-004 for SPRINT-2025-11-18. Removed all blocking prompts from ginko log, implemented smart defaults (auto-include files, auto-create context modules, detect category/impact), added educational feedback (quality scoring, WHAT/WHY/HOW breakdown, coaching tips), and fixed session log writing bug (fs-extra ESM import issue). Result: AI partners can now log events without ANY user interaction. Zero prompts, immediate execution, rich educational feedback.
