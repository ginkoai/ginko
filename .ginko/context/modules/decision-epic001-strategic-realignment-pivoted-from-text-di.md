# EPIC-001 Strategic Realignment: Pivoted from text display...

**Type**: decision  
**Tags**: decision, high  
**Created**: 2025-11-21  

## Context

EPIC-002 (AI-Native Sprint Graphs) requires graph relationships for cognitive scaffolding, not text parsing. Original Sprint 1 (team activity feed, patterns display) would need 14-18h rework. Solution: Revised all 4 sprints to build graph infrastructure first - Sprint→Task, Task→File, Task→Event, Epic→Problem relationships. Impact: Zero rework for EPIC-002, direct foundation for 5-10x AI productivity improvements. Created new Sprint 1 plan (SPRINT-2025-12-graph-infrastructure.md) focused on Tier 1 relationships.

## Decision

Revised all 4 sprints to build graph infrastructure first - Sprint→Task, Task→File, Task→Event, Epic→Problem relationships. Impact: Zero rework for EPIC-002, direct foundation for 5-10x AI productivity improvements. Created new Sprint 1 plan (SPRINT-2025-12-graph-infrastructure.md) focused on Tier 1 relationships.

## Rationale

EPIC-001 Strategic Realignment: Pivoted from text display to graph-first architecture. Root cause: EPIC-002 (AI-Native Sprint Graphs) requires graph relationships for cognitive scaffolding, not text parsing. Original Sprint 1 (team activity feed, patterns display) would need 14-18h rework. Solution: Revised all 4 sprints to build graph infrastructure first - Sprint→Task, Task→File, Task→Event, Epic→Problem relationships. Impact: Zero rework for EPIC-002, direct foundation for 5-10x AI productivity improvements. Created new Sprint 1 plan (SPRINT-2025-12-graph-infrastructure.md) focused on Tier 1 relationships.
