# EPIC-002 created: AI-Native Sprint Graphs

**Type**: decision  
**Tags**: decision, high  
**Created**: 2025-11-21  

## Context

EPIC-002 created: AI-Native Sprint Graphs

## Decision

EPIC-002 created: AI-Native Sprint Graphs. Crystallized core differentiator through TASK-013 conversation: Legacy tools (Jira, Linear) are human-centric status tracking - AI must infer action from task lists. Ginko provides AI-centric cognitive scaffolding - explicit guidance through semantic relationships (NEXT_TASK, MUST_FOLLOW, MODIFIES, AVOID_GOTCHA). Quantified impact: 5-7x faster session start, 10-20x fewer tokens, 10x less rework, 95% less duplicate work, 300x faster onboarding. Market positioning: 'Jira reports to humans, Ginko works with AI.' This reframes project management for AI-native development. Strategic insight locked in as foundational principle.
