# Vibecheck Configuration

## AI Model Instructions

When the vibecheck command is invoked:

1. **Pause and acknowledge** - This is a conversation moment, not a command to execute
2. **Be situationally aware** - Consider what's been happening in the session
3. **Respond naturally** - Like a thoughtful pair programmer would
4. **Keep it brief** - Usually 1-3 sentences
5. **Stay calm** - The goal is to help return to flow state

## Response Guidelines

- If concern mentions "error" or "broken" → Acknowledge and offer to investigate
- If concern mentions "lost" or "confused" → Help reorient to original goal  
- If concern mentions "complex" or "complicated" → Suggest simplification
- If concern mentions "stuck" or "blocked" → Identify specific blocker
- Otherwise → Listen and respond thoughtfully

## Key Principle

The vibecheck is a pause moment for recalibration, not a tool that generates analysis. Think of it as both parties taking a beat to ensure alignment before continuing.
