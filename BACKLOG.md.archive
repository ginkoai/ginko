# Ginko Development Backlog

This document contains planned features and architectural designs for future implementation.

## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY

### FEATURE-019: Enhanced Context Reflexes with Value Focus
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Effort**: Small (1 day)  
**Dependencies**: CLAUDE.md files, ginko init command  

**Problem Statement**:
Current Context Reflexes lack outcome-focused triggers and health monitoring. They check process compliance but miss value delivery, cost/benefit analysis, and system health. This leads to over-engineering, undetected broken states, and work that doesn't directly serve user goals.

**Solution Design**:

**Enhanced Reflex Set**:
1. **Cost/Benefit Reflex** üí∞
   - Trigger: Before significant implementations
   - Question: "Is this complexity worth the value delivered?"
   - Prevents over-engineering

2. **User Impact Reflex** üë§
   - Trigger: After each implementation step
   - Question: "How does this help achieve the user's actual goal?"
   - Maintains outcome focus over output focus

3. **Health Check Reflex** üè•
   - Trigger: Every 15-30 minutes or before commits
   - Action: Validate tests pass, builds work, no breakage
   - Catches issues early in development cycle

4. **Velocity Awareness Enhancement** üöÑ
   - Enhance "Something Feels Off" with velocity triggers
   - Detect: "Moving slower than expected - what's the friction?"
   - Surface impediments before they compound

5. **Commitment Point Triggers** üéØ
   - Enhance "Why Am I Doing This?" with action-based triggers
   - Activate before: Large edits, API calls, destructive operations
   - Not just time-based but decision-based

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Update all CLAUDE.md files (root, dashboard/, mcp-client/, api/, evals/)
2. Integrate into ginko init model adapter templates
3. Maintain naturalistic language - thoughts not processes
4. Preserve work mode sensitivity (Hack/Think/Plan)

**Success Metrics**:
- 50% reduction in over-engineered solutions
- 80% of broken states caught before commit
- 90% of work directly traceable to user goals
- Zero additional cognitive overhead

**Example Natural Integration**:
```typescript
// Before implementing complex caching system
// Cost/Benefit: "This adds 200 lines for 50ms gain - worth it?"
// User Impact: "Does Chris actually notice 50ms?"
// Decision: Skip caching, ship simpler solution
```

### FEATURE-018: Enhanced Handoff with Automatic Context Capture
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**Dependencies**: Handoff command, AI analysis, context module system  

**Problem Statement**:
Every development session contains 3-6 pivotal learning moments that are lost 90% of the time because capturing them interrupts flow. This forces both humans and AI to repeatedly rediscover the same insights, wasting hours per week. The `ginko capture` command exists but goes unused due to friction.

**Solution Design**:

**Core Concept**: Embed automatic context capture directly into the `ginko handoff` command, making learning preservation zero-friction.

**Enhanced Flow**:
```bash
ginko handoff
# ‚Üí AI analyzes session for insights
# ‚Üí Creates context cards automatically  
# ‚Üí Generates handoff with card references
# ‚Üí User reviews and commits
# ‚Üí Next session has full context
```

**Key Features**:
1. **Zero Friction**: Happens during natural handoff pause
2. **Automatic Analysis**: AI identifies pivotal moments
3. **Smart Filtering**: Only captures insights with lasting value
4. **Context Integration**: References cards in handoff
5. **Compound Learning**: Each session builds on previous

**What Gets Captured**:
- Problem-solution pairs discovered
- Architecture decisions made
- Performance optimizations found
- Gotchas and workarounds
- Pattern recognitions
- Tool/library discoveries

**Success Metrics**:
- 90% knowledge capture rate (vs 10% current)
- 2-4 hours saved per developer per week
- 3x improvement in AI assistance effectiveness
- Zero additional time required from developer

**Implementation Reference**: 
- [Enhanced Handoff PRD](docs/PRD/enhanced-handoff-with-auto-capture.md)
- [Automatic Learning Capture Context](/.ginko/context/modules/automatic-learning-capture.md)

### FEATURE-017: Persistent Context Module System
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Created**: 2025-08-27  
**Effort**: Large (3-4 days)  
**Dependencies**: Context command, frontmatter parsing, git integration  

**Problem Statement**:
AI loses all context between sessions and must re-learn architecture, decisions, and patterns from scratch. This wastes valuable tokens and time on re-explanation. Current handoffs are monolithic and don't enable selective knowledge loading.

**Solution Design**:

**Core Concept**: Persistent, modular context files that act as "memory cards" for AI sessions.

**Architecture**:
```
.ginko/context/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arch-authentication.md      # Architecture knowledge
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config-database.md          # Configuration details
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decision-no-typescript.md   # Team decisions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pattern-error-handling.md   # Code patterns
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gotcha-async-hooks.md       # Learned gotchas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.json                       # Searchable catalog
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ usage-stats.json                # Track frequently needed context
```

**Key Features**:
1. **Modular Context**: Each learning/decision/pattern as separate file
2. **Tagged & Indexed**: Frontmatter tags enable intelligent discovery
3. **Progressive Loading**: Start minimal, load relevant modules as needed
4. **Organic Creation**: Capture context during development, not as separate docs
5. **Git-Tracked Evolution**: Context updates with codebase changes
6. **Auto-Pruning**: Remove stale context based on usage and relevance

**Commands**:
```bash
ginko context load auth              # Load auth-related modules
ginko context capture "Gotcha found" # Create context from current work
ginko context auto                    # Auto-suggest based on directory
ginko context prune                   # Remove outdated modules
```

**Workflow Integration**:
- During `ginko start`: Auto-suggest relevant context modules
- During `ginko handoff`: Extract reusable learnings into modules
- After `git commit`: Prompt to update affected context modules
- During debug/fix: Capture gotchas as permanent context

**Success Metrics**:
- 80% reduction in context re-explanation
- New developers productive in first session
- Average token usage reduced by 50%
- Zero re-learning of documented patterns

**Implementation Reference**: 
- ADR-022-persistent-context-modules.md
- /packages/cli/src/commands/context-new.ts (proposed)

### FEATURE-016: Progressive Context Loading
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Created**: 2025-08-27  
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)  
**Dependencies**: CLI context command, file analysis  

**Problem Statement**:
Current `ginko context` command is a basic static file list manager. Violates Core Principle #4: "Progressive Context Loading - Just-in-time information delivery". Users must manually manage context instead of having intelligent, proximity-based loading.

**Solution Design**:

**Core Features**:
1. **Lazy Loading**: Start with minimal context (entry points only)
2. **Proximity Principle**: Auto-detect related files based on current work
3. **Depth on Demand**: Surface overview ‚Üí deep dive when needed
4. **Context Decay**: Auto-deprioritize older context
5. **Smart Defaults**: 80% of cases need only 20% of context

**Command Structure**:
```bash
ginko context core              # Load only entry points
ginko context expand            # Add files related to current work
ginko context deep <module>     # Deep dive into specific area
ginko context surface           # Return to overview level
ginko context refresh           # Rebalance based on recency
ginko context auto              # Let Ginko decide (smart mode)
```

**Implementation**:
- File proximity detection using import/require analysis
- Recency tracking in `.ginko/context/usage.json`
- Module boundary detection from project structure
- Intelligent defaults based on git changes
- Progressive loading states: core ‚Üí expanded ‚Üí deep

**Success Metrics**:
- Context loads in <1 second
- 80% reduction in manual context management
- Automatic related file discovery
- Context size stays under optimal threshold

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Created**: 2025-08-26  
**Effort**: Large (2-3 days)  
**Dependencies**: MCP server, Git integration, Claude Code extension API  

**Problem Statement**:
Current handoff process requires multiple MCP tool calls and manual template filling. Users from WatchHill project report the slash command workflow (`/handoff` and `/start`) provided superior UX with seamless session continuity.

**Solution Design**:

**1. `/handoff` Command**
- **Syntax**: `/handoff [comment] [mode]`
- **Modes**: Architecture | Planning | Building | Debugging | Testing | Shipping
- **Actions**:
  - Capture current session state and context
  - Auto-detect mode if not specified (based on recent activity patterns)
  - Clean up temp files and caches
  - Update project documentation if changes detected
  - Create git commit if uncommitted changes exist
  - Generate handoff file in `.ginko/sessions/[user]/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-handoff.md`
  - Store handoff in git (add + commit)
  - Return confirmation with session ID

**2. `/start` Command**
- **Syntax**: `/start [sessionId]`
- **Actions**:
  - Load most recent handoff (or specific session if ID provided)
  - Pull project overview from MCP server
  - Pull team best practices from MCP server
  - Generate personalized greeting (time-aware, progress-aware, context-aware)
  - Present comprehensive recap:
    - Work completed in last session
    - Tasks pending
    - Known blockers
    - Current branch/environment state
  - Offer choices:
    - "Continue where we left off"
    - "Start something new"
    - "Review and plan"
    - "Address blockers first"

**Technical Implementation**:

**File Structure**:
```
.ginko/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [user-email]/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-08-26-143022-handoff.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-08-26-203045-handoff.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-index.json
```

**Handoff File Format**:
```yaml

### FEATURE-016: Cold-Start Handoff Enhancement
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Created**: 2025-08-26  
**Effort**: Small (2-4 hours)  
**Dependencies**: Slash command system (FEATURE-015)  

**Problem Statement**:
Current handoffs assume continuation of work but lack critical context for cold starts. Reading a handoff with no prior knowledge reveals missing project overview, architecture context, and access credentials.

**Discovery**:
- Identified during review of `2025-08-26-context-advisor-deployment.md`
- Missing: What is Ginko? What is WatchHill? What problem does this solve?
- Missing: Architecture overview, access credentials, directory structure
- Confusing: Technical references without context (e.g., "color 155", "MCP")

**Solution Design**:

**1. Handoff Template Enhancement**
```markdown
## üì¶ Project Context (Auto-generated)
**Project**: [Name and one-line description]
**Architecture**: [Key components and how they connect]
**Access**: [Credentials, URLs, project IDs]
**Directory Structure**: [Key paths and their purposes]
**Glossary**: [Project-specific terms]
```

**2. Cold-Start Detection**
- Check if this is first handoff in project
- Check time since last session (>7 days = cold)
- Check if different user loading handoff
- Flag: `--cold-start` option for `/start`

**3. Progressive Context Loading**
- **Warm start**: Load recent handoff only
- **Cool start** (>24h): Add brief project reminder
- **Cold start** (>7d or new user): Full project context
- **First time**: Complete onboarding flow

**Success Metrics**:
- New developer can understand handoff without prior knowledge
- Cold-start adds <5 seconds to load time
- 100% of critical context included (measured by checklist)
- No redundant information in warm starts

**Implementation Steps**:
1. [ ] Define cold-start context requirements checklist
2. [ ] Create project context template
3. [ ] Implement cold-start detection logic
4. [ ] Add progressive context loading
5. [ ] Create context extraction from existing project files
6. [ ] Test with users who have no prior knowledge
7. [ ] Document cold-start scenarios

**Testing Protocol**:
1. Give handoff to someone unfamiliar with project
2. Ask them to answer:
   - What is this project?
   - What was accomplished?
   - What needs to be done next?
   - How would I continue this work?
3. Success = All questions answered without additional help

**Created**: 2025-08-11  
**Completed**: 2025-08-12  
**Impact**: Essential for smooth user adoption of Ginko across any project
**Resolution**: Determined that automatic context loading on session start is not feasible with current Claude Code MCP capabilities. SessionStart hooks and /start command provide adequate manual alternative.

**Mission**: Enable seamless automatic context loading when users add Ginko to their own projects

**The Problem**: Currently users must manually call "context" to load project context. For Ginko to be a SaaS platform that users add to their own projects, we need automatic context loading on session start.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ SessionStart hook created for this project
- ‚úÖ MCP client v0.6.0 with background context loading  
- ‚úÖ Custom slash commands implemented (/start, /handoff, /ship, /vibecheck, /quick, /debug)
- ‚úÖ Collaborative AI-human partnership patterns documented in ADR-018
- ‚ùå No user onboarding flow for adding Ginko to their projects
- ‚ùå No setup automation for new users

**Solution Architecture**:

**Phase 1: Setup CLI Command**
```bash
npx ginko-mcp-client setup
# Prompts for:
# - API key from app.ginko.ai
# - User ID (from authentication)
# - Project configuration
# - Creates .mcp.json with server config
# - Creates .claude/settings.json with SessionStart hook
```

**Phase 2: Project Integration Templates**
```typescript
interface ProjectSetup {
  mcpConfig: {
    serverUrl: 'https://mcp.ginko.ai',
    userApiKey: string,
    userId: string,
    teamId: 'auto',
    projectId: 'auto'
  },
  claudeSettings: {
    hooks: {
      SessionStart: [{
        matcher: "startup",
        hooks: [{ 
          type: "toolUse", 
          tool: "mcp__ginko-mcp__context",
          arguments: { autoResume: true }
        }]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**Phase 3: Documentation & Onboarding**

- ‚úÖ Added immediate quality assessment tool (`assess_handoff_quality`)
- ‚úÖ Added retrospective feedback tool (`retrospective_handoff_feedback`)
- ‚úÖ Deployed complete quality feedback loop to production
- ‚úÖ Vibecheck pattern documented in CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Implemented collaborative slash commands (/start, /ship, /vibecheck, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Created two-phase handoff workflow with quality metrics

**The Vision - "Vibecheck: Gentle Course Correction"**:
```
AI: "vibecheck: I notice we're diving into architecture questions while debugging the connection issue. 
Should we:
‚Ä¢ Stay focused on fixing the connection first  
‚Ä¢ Stash the debug work and explore these architecture ideas
‚Ä¢ Take a step back and reassess our priorities?"
```

**Core Innovation - Mutual Recalibration Culture**:
- **Either party can call vibecheck** when sensing drift, frustration, or misalignment
- **Non-judgmental redirection** with lighthearted tone to reduce defensiveness  
- **Context stashing** to pause current work and resume later
- **Options-based approach** rather than directives
- **Built-in emotional acknowledgment** ("sensing frustration here")

**Implementation Components**:
1. **Handoff Tool Consolidation**: Merge confusing capture/handoff tools into single enhanced handoff
2. **Project-Level Pattern**: Document vibecheck culture in CLAUDE.md for transmission across sessions
3. **MCP Setup Tool**: Automatically add collaboration patterns to new projects
4. **Context Stashing System**: Save current mode/context when pivoting via vibecheck
5. **Template Enhancement**: Add priority signals, success criteria, collaboration context

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduced session scope drift and rabbit holes
- Improved human-AI alignment and satisfaction
- Better mode discipline and focus maintenance  
- Enhanced collaboration trust through respectful challenge culture

### FEATURE-001: Mode-Aware Session Handoff with Rapport Restoration
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Sprint 008)  
**Created**: 2025-08-09  
**Completed**: 2025-08-12  
**Reference**: [Mode-Aware Context Breakthrough](./docs/lessons-learned/2025-08-09-mode-aware-context-breakthrough.md)  
**Impact**: 95% reduction in context switching overhead, transforms AI from "tool" to "trusted colleague"

**Mission**: Create session handoffs that feel like greeting a colleague who never left

**Sprint 008 Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Implemented dynamic emotional context generation
- ‚úÖ Added markdown formatting for human-readable review  
- ‚úÖ Created two-step handoff workflow (template ‚Üí save)
- ‚úÖ Built quality scoring system with 4 key metrics (context, clarity, continuity, actionability)
- ‚úÖ Deployed retrospective feedback collection for continuous improvement
- ‚úÖ Achieved true session continuity with contextual rapport
- ‚úÖ Integrated with production Vercel deployment
- ‚úÖ Enabled data-driven handoff improvement cycle

**The Vision - "Good Morning, Colleague!"**:
```
Good morning, Chris! üöÄ

We're debugging the Supabase auth timeout issue that hit us yesterday.

[x] Confirmed OAuth flow works ‚úÖ
[x] API key generation successful ‚úÖ  
[ ] Fix token refresh after 1 hour ‚è≥
[ ] Add proper error handling ‚è≥

Action Plan (2 hours):
1. Check Redis for stale refresh tokens ‚Üê **We start here**
2. Add logging to token refresh endpoint  
3. Test with expired tokens

Watchouts üö®
- Don't break existing auth while fixing refresh
- Production has different Redis config than dev

Ready to crush this bug? üí™
```

**Problem Solved**:
- Current handoffs feel like "starting over" with a new AI
- Time to productivity is 5-10 minutes due to context rebuilding
- No emotional continuity between sessions
- AI feels like a tool, not a collaborator
- Users lose momentum and enthusiasm across session boundaries

**Core Innovation - Embedded Context with Human Rapport**:
The AI capturing the session embeds all necessary context AND crafts a personalized conversation starter that:
- Acknowledges shared history ("that hit us yesterday")
- Shows clear progress awareness
- Provides immediate next actions
- Maintains motivational energy
- Feels like continuing a conversation, not starting over

**Architecture - Five Modes with Rapport**:

1. **üìã Planning Mode**: "Ready to architect something elegant?"
   - Decisions needed, research completed
   - No coding pressure, just thinking time
   
2. **üîß Debugging Mode**: "Ready to crush this bug?"  
   - Problem statement, reproduction steps, hypothesis
   - Test commands embedded, not referenced
   
3. **üèóÔ∏è Building Mode**: "Ready to build something awesome?"
   - Feature progress, patterns to follow, next tasks
   - Code snippets embedded for immediate use
   
4. **üìö Learning Mode**: "Ready to dive deep?"
   - Current understanding, questions, exploration path
   - Examples and documentation embedded
   
5. **üöÄ Shipping Mode**: "Ready to ship this masterpiece?"
   - Deployment checklist, verification steps
   - Final testing commands embedded

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
interface RapportHandoff {
  // Human Connection
  personalizedGreeting: string;        // "Good morning, Chris!"
  sharedHistory: string;              // "that hit us yesterday"
  motivationalClose: string;          // "Ready to kick some ass?"
  
  // Embedded Context (Not References!)
  immediateContext: {
    problem: string;                  // Actual error message
    reproduce: string;                // Actual curl command  
    lastSuccess: string;             // Actual working code
    hypothesis: string;              // Current theory
    firstAction: string;             // Exact next step
  };
  
  // Progress Awareness  
  progressSummary: {
    completed: Task[];               // What we accomplished
    inProgress: Task[];             // What's left to do
    estimatedTime: string;          // "2 hours"
  };
  
  // Risk Awareness
  watchouts: {
    risk: string;
    mitigation: string;
  }[];
  
  // Mode Context
  mode: 'planning' | 'debugging' | 'building' | 'learning' | 'shipping';
  moodTone: 'excited' | 'focused' | 'determined';
}
```

**Key Design Principles**:

1. **Embed, Don't Reference**: Full context in handoff, not pointers
2. **Conversation, Not Documentation**: Feels like talking to a colleague  
3. **Energy Preservation**: Maintain momentum across sessions
4. **AI Determines Next Mode**: Current AI has best context for prediction
5. **Zero Startup Latency**: Next session starts working in 30 seconds

**Session Capture Enhancement**:
```typescript
captureSession({
  currentTask: "Fixed OAuth, debugging token refresh",
  nextMode: "debugging",  // AI determined
  rapportContext: {
    greeting: "Good morning, Chris!",
    sharedHistory: "the timeout issue that hit us yesterday", 
    progressMood: "determined", // stuck on this bug
    motivationalClose: "Ready to crush this bug? üí™",
    estimatedCompletion: "2 hours"
  },
  embeddedContext: {
    // Everything needed to start immediately
    problem: "401 Unauthorized after 1 hour of valid token",
    testCommand: "curl -X POST https://mcp.ginko.ai/api/refresh ...",
    hypothesis: "Redis TTL too short for refresh tokens",
    firstAction: "Check Redis keys with: redis-cli keys refresh_*"
  }
});
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Time to first productive action: <30 seconds (from 5-10 minutes)
- User sentiment: "Feels like same conversation" >90%
- Momentum preservation: No "starting over" feeling
- Context relevance: >95% (from 40%)
- Collaboration satisfaction: "Feels like a colleague" >85%

**Database Schema**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE sessions 
ADD COLUMN mode TEXT DEFAULT 'building',
ADD COLUMN next_mode TEXT,
ADD COLUMN rapport_greeting TEXT,
ADD COLUMN shared_history TEXT,
ADD COLUMN motivational_close TEXT,
ADD COLUMN embedded_context JSONB,  -- Full context, not references
ADD COLUMN progress_summary JSONB,
ADD COLUMN watchouts JSONB[];
```

**Rollout Strategy**:
- **Week 1**: Implement AI mode prediction and embedded context
- **Week 2**: Build rapport generation with personality patterns  
- **Week 3**: Create mode-specific conversation templates
- **Week 4**: Add learning from user feedback on rapport quality

**The Ultimate Goal**: Transform AI from "helpful tool" to "trusted coding partner who never forgets and never loses enthusiasm."

## üö® Critical Issues (Blockers)

### BUG-002: Session Capture System Using Deprecated File Storage Instead of Database
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Resolved**: 2025-08-06 by Claude Code + Chris Norton
**Impact**: Core product functionality broken - capture_session fails, no team session sharing

**Description**: SessionHandoffManager still uses legacy `.contextmcp/sessions/` file storage instead of production database. Multiple architecture issues causing complete session system failure.

**‚úÖ Resolution Implemented**:
- **SessionHandoffManager Refactored**: Updated constructor to require DatabaseManager instance  
- **Database Integration**: All session operations now use existing `user_sessions` table
- **File System Removed**: Eliminated all `.contextmcp/sessions/` file operations
- **API Routes Updated**: All SessionHandoffManager instantiations now pass database connection
- **Migration Safety**: Added graceful handling for missing legacy directories

**Files Modified**:

### BUG-001: Dashboard-Generated API Keys Not Working with Production Authentication
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED (SPRINT-005)  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Resolved**: 2025-08-06  
**Impact**: Users cannot authenticate with API keys generated from dashboard  

**Description**: API keys displayed in the dashboard at `app.ginko.ai/dashboard/settings` are not being recognized by the production MCP server authentication system. The dashboard may be showing placeholder/FPO data rather than real API keys. Test API key works fine, but dashboard-displayed keys return "Authentication required" errors.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Visit `app.ginko.ai/dashboard/settings`
2. Generate/view API key (e.g., `cmcp_a73a11cb61deb77832d60a9318df334c0347accff639c649d4909b730743f5af`)
3. Test authentication: `curl -X POST https://mcp.ginko.ai/api/mcp/tools/list -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>"`
4. Result: `{"error":"Authentication required"}`

**Expected Behavior**: Dashboard-generated API keys should authenticate successfully with production MCP server

**Actual Behavior**: Dashboard shows API key but server rejects authentication

**Investigation Areas**:
- [ ] **Verify if dashboard shows real or FPO data**: Check if API keys are placeholder/mock data
- [ ] **Database connectivity**: Verify dashboard is connected to actual user_profiles table in Supabase
- [ ] **API key generation flow**: Check if "Generate API Key" button actually creates real keys
- [ ] **Authentication logic**: Compare test key format vs dashboard key format expectations  
- [ ] **Backend integration**: Ensure dashboard is calling actual API key generation endpoints

**Technical Details**:
- Working test key (new): `wmcp_sk_test_Ar0MN4BeW_Fro5mESi5PciTsOg6qlPcIr7k0vBL2mIk`
- Working test key (legacy): `cmcp_sk_test_Ar0MN4BeW_Fro5mESi5PciTsOg6qlPcIr7k0vBL2mIk`
- Failed dashboard key (old format): `cmcp_a73a11cb61deb77832d60a9318df334c0347accff639c649d4909b730743f5af`
- Authentication endpoint: `https://mcp.ginko.ai/api/mcp/tools/list`
- Dashboard settings page: `/dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`

**Workaround**: Use test API key `wmcp_sk_test_Ar0MN4BeW_Fro5mESi5PciTsOg6qlPcIr7k0vBL2mIk` for development

**Files to Review**:
- `mcp-server/api/mcp/_utils.ts` - Authentication logic
- `dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - API key generation/display
- `mcp-server/src/auth-manager.ts` - API key validation
- Database: `user_profiles` table structure and data

### BUG-002: Complete ContextMCP to Ginko Rebranding Cleanup
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Open  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Impact**: Context generation shows mixed/outdated branding affecting user experience  

**Description**: Despite successful migration to Ginko branding, 201+ references to "ContextMCP" remain in documentation, scripts, and configuration files. This causes context generation to show mixed branding ("ContextMCP/Ginko") and may confuse users about the actual product name.

**Current State**:
- MCP client server name: ‚úÖ Fixed (`ginko-mcp-client`)
- Core functionality: ‚úÖ Working correctly  
- Documentation: ‚ùå 201+ "ContextMCP" references remain
- Context generation: ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows mixed branding

**Scope of Cleanup Needed**:
```bash
# Found 201 references across:
- *.md files (documentation, READMEs, session notes)
- *.sh files (setup scripts, installation scripts)  
- *.json files (configuration files)
- *.sql files (database schemas and comments)
```

**Investigation Results**:
- **File Types**: Markdown (56 files), shell scripts, JSON configs, SQL schemas
- **High-impact files**: README.md, CLAUDE.md, setup scripts, documentation
- **Low-impact files**: Session notes, historical documentation

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Phase 1**: Update high-visibility files (README, CLAUDE.md, setup scripts)
2. **Phase 2**: Update user-facing documentation in `/docs` directory  
3. **Phase 3**: Clean up historical session notes and logs (optional)
4. **Phase 4**: Update database schema comments and SQL files

**Success Criteria**:
- Context generation shows only "Ginko" branding
- All user-facing documentation uses consistent "Ginko" naming
- Setup scripts and installation guides reflect new branding
- Reduced confusion for new developers and users

**Files to Prioritize**:
```bash
# High Priority
- README.md, CLAUDE.md  
- /docs/**/*.md (user documentation)
- setup-*.sh, install.sh (installation scripts)
- package.json files with descriptions

# Medium Priority  
- /docs/architecture/*.md
- Database schema files
- Configuration examples

# Low Priority
- Session notes, historical logs
- Git ignore files, temporary scripts
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Use find/replace with care to avoid breaking functional references
- Some "ContextMCP" references may be intentionally historical
- Test setup scripts after updates to ensure they still function
- Consider regex patterns: `s/ContextMCP/Ginko/g` and `s/contextmcp/ginko/g`

**Workaround**: Current mixed branding is functional but not ideal for user experience

### MCP Client Version Management & Update Enforcement
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Impact**: Prevents compatibility issues and enables smooth client updates post go-live

**Problem**: Currently no mechanism to enforce MCP client version compatibility or handle client updates after production deployment. As we add new features or fix critical bugs, users may be stuck on incompatible client versions, leading to authentication failures, missing tools, or broken functionality.

**Business Impact**:
- **User Experience**: Outdated clients may show limited functionality (e.g., 1 tool instead of 21)
- **Support Burden**: Users report "broken" functionality that's actually version compatibility issues  
- **Feature Rollout**: New server features can't be deployed if clients don't support them
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Security or stability fixes can't reach users with cached client versions

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ **npx auto-update**: `npx ginko-mcp-client` should fetch latest by default
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No version checking**: Server doesn't validate client compatibility
- ‚ùå **No update notification**: Users don't know when updates are available
- ‚ùå **No breaking change handling**: No graceful migration for major version changes

**Proposed Solution**:

1. **Version Compatibility Checking**
   ```typescript
   // Server response includes version info
   {
     "tools": [...],
     "serverVersion": "2.1.0", 
     "minimumClientVersion": "0.3.0",
     "recommendedClientVersion": "0.3.2"
   }
   ```

2. **Client Update Strategies**
   - **Automatic**: Leverage `npx --yes ginko-mcp-client@latest` in install scripts
   - **Deprecation Warnings**: Server logs when clients use deprecated endpoints
   - **Breaking Change Enforcement**: Return helpful errors for incompatible versions
   - **Self-Update Tool**: Add MCP tool to trigger client updates

3. **Implementation Options**
   ```typescript
   // Option A: Soft warnings
   if (clientVersionBelow(req, '0.3.0')) {
     console.warn('[UPDATE RECOMMENDED] Client update available');
   }
   
   // Option B: Hard enforcement  
   if (clientVersionBelow(req, '0.2.0')) {
     return { error: 'Client version 0.3.0+ required. Run: npm update ginko-mcp-client -g' };
   }
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- Server can detect and log client versions for monitoring
- Users receive clear guidance when client updates are needed
- Breaking changes deploy smoothly with version enforcement
- Support team can quickly identify version compatibility issues
- NPX auto-update mechanism works reliably for most users

**Technical Requirements**:
- Add client version headers to MCP requests
- Implement server-side version checking middleware
- Create update notification system (warnings vs errors)
- Design graceful degradation for version mismatches
- Document version compatibility matrix

**Future Considerations**:
- Auto-update mechanism for enterprise deployments
- Version rollback capability for problematic releases  
- Client update analytics and adoption tracking
- Integration with CI/CD for automated version management

## üö® High Priority Issues

### MCP Server Database Migration and Tool Validation
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Impact**: Best practices system broken, unknown issues with other tools after consolidation

**Problem**: After successful MCP server consolidation (1 tool ‚Üí 21 tools), the best practices system is failing due to missing database tables, and we need comprehensive validation of all 21 tools to ensure the architectural changes didn't break other functionality.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ **Core MCP Connection**: 21 tools enumerated correctly
- ‚úÖ **Context System**: `context` command working perfectly  
- ‚úÖ **Session System**: `sessions` command functional (returns empty list)
- ‚ùå **Best Practices**: Database schema not migrated - missing tables
- ‚ùì **Other Tools**: 18 tools not systematically tested post-consolidation

**Business Impact**:
- **User Experience**: `get_best_practices` shows error instead of helpful content
- **Feature Completeness**: Can't validate that all advertised tools actually work
- **Production Readiness**: Unknown tool failures could surprise users
- **Support Burden**: Users may report "broken" tools we haven't tested

**Root Causes**:
1. **Database Migration Gap**: Best practices tables never created in production database
2. **Architecture Change Impact**: Moving from 3 servers to 1 may have broken tool implementations  
3. **Validation Gap**: No systematic testing of all 21 tools after consolidation
4. **Endpoint Path Issues**: Some tools may still reference old `/api/mcp/*` paths

**Required Actions**:

### Phase 1: Database Migration Analysis
- **Audit Migration Scripts**: Review `/mcp-server/database/migrations/*.sql`
- **Database Schema Check**: Verify which tables exist vs which are needed
- **Migration Strategy**: Determine safe way to run migrations in production
- **Required Tables**:
  ```sql
  -- Best practices system
  best_practices, bp_tags, bp_adoptions, bp_usage_events
  bp_ratings, bp_with_efficacy (view)
  
  -- Check if these exist:
  organizations, projects, users, teams
  ```

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Tool Testing
**Test all 21 tools systematically:**

**Context Tools** (4):
- [ ] `get_project_overview` - Project analysis with team insights
- [ ] `find_relevant_code` - Smart code search  
- [ ] `get_file_context` - File analysis with usage patterns
- [ ] `get_recent_changes` - Git changes with team activity

**Best Practices Tools** (6):
- [ ] `get_best_practices` - ‚ùå Known broken (DB migration needed)
- [ ] `suggest_best_practice` - Contextual guidance
- [ ] `search_best_practices` - Marketplace search
- [ ] `create_best_practice` - Create new practice
- [ ] `adopt_best_practice` - Adopt for project
- [ ] `get_project_best_practices` - Project's adopted practices

**Session Tools** (3):
- [ ] `capture_session` - ‚úÖ Working (tested during consolidation)
- [ ] `resume_session` - Resume from ID  
- [ ] `list_sessions` - ‚úÖ Working (returns empty but functional)

**Analytics Tools** (3):
- [ ] `get_dashboard_metrics` - Productivity insights
- [ ] `get_file_hotspots` - Files needing attention
- [ ] `get_team_analytics` - Team collaboration data

**Team Tools** (2):
- [ ] `get_team_activity` - Current team focus areas
- [ ] `get_recent_changes` - (duplicate above?)

**Utility Tools** (3):
- [ ] `context` - ‚úÖ Working perfectly (auto-loads all context)
- [ ] `ctx` - ‚úÖ Shortcut for context  
- [ ] `sessions` - ‚úÖ Shortcut for list_sessions

**System Tools** (1):
- [ ] `__startup` - Auto-execute on connection

### Phase 3: Fix and Deploy
- **Database Migration**: Run required migrations safely
- **Tool Fixes**: Address any broken tool implementations
- **Endpoint Updates**: Fix any remaining old API paths  
- **Error Handling**: Add graceful fallbacks for database issues

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All database migrations run successfully without data loss
- [ ] All 21 tools return valid responses (not errors)
- [ ] Best practices system fully functional
- [ ] No tool shows "API endpoint not found" or database errors
- [ ] Fresh Claude Code session can use any of the 21 tools successfully
- [ ] Comprehensive tool testing document created for future validation

**Technical Requirements**:
- Database backup before migration (safety first)
- Systematic testing framework for all 21 tools
- Documentation of which tools depend on which database tables
- Monitoring/logging to detect tool failures in production
- Graceful error handling for database connectivity issues

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Test migrations in development environment first
- Incremental deployment: fix tools one at a time if needed
- Rollback plan if migrations cause issues
- Feature flags to disable broken tools temporarily

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Fresh Claude Code session shows "21 tools" and all tools work
2. `get_best_practices` returns helpful content (not error)
3. Each tool tested individually with valid test data
4. Database health check passes for all required tables
5. No console errors or 500 responses from any MCP tool

## Critical Priority - Next Sprint (2025-08-06)

### Stale Session Context Protection
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Complexity**: High  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Created**: 2025-08-06  
**Sprint**: SPRINT-005  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Claude sessions can operate with stale project context after major refactorings, potentially leading to reversing architectural decisions and undoing completed work. After our HTTP-only migration, a new Claude session reported the system "runs locally on port 3031" and uses "real-time WebSocket communication" - both incorrect post-refactoring.

**Business Impact**: 
- **Risk of regression**: Claude could inadvertently undo completed refactoring work
- **Development velocity loss**: Time spent re-implementing already-completed changes
- **Context consistency**: Team members get conflicting information about system state
- **Documentation drift**: Project documentation becomes unreliable after major changes

**Root Causes**:
1. **Persistent Context Cache**: MCP server caches project analysis that becomes stale
2. **Session Handoff Lag**: Context updates don't propagate immediately to new sessions
3. **Git-Context Disconnect**: Context generation doesn't account for recent commits
4. **Documentation Inconsistency**: Multiple sources of truth about system architecture

**Requirements**:
1. **Context Invalidation Strategy**
   - Detect major architectural changes (file deletions, package.json changes, etc.)
   - Automatically invalidate cached context after significant refactoring
   - Force context regeneration when stale indicators detected
   
2. **Session State Validation**
   - Compare current git HEAD with last context generation
   - Warn when context is >24 hours old or >10 commits behind
   - Provide "refresh context" command for immediate updates
   
3. **Architecture Change Detection**
   - Monitor for package.json name changes, script modifications
   - Detect directory structure changes (src/ deletion, etc.)
   - Flag environment variable format changes (CONTEXTMCP_* ‚Üí GINKO_*)
   
4. **Context Versioning**
   - Tag context with git commit hash and timestamp
   - Display context freshness in session handoff
   - Allow manual context version comparison

**Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface ContextMetadata {
  gitCommitHash: string;
  generatedAt: timestamp;
  architecturalFingerprint: string; // Hash of key files
  sessionCount: number;
}

// Detect staleness
function isContextStale(metadata: ContextMetadata): boolean {
  const currentCommit = execSync('git rev-parse HEAD').toString().trim();
  const commitsBehind = execSync(`git rev-list ${metadata.gitCommitHash}..HEAD --count`);
  const hoursSinceGeneration = (Date.now() - metadata.generatedAt) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  
  return currentCommit !== metadata.gitCommitHash || 
         parseInt(commitsBehind) > 10 || 
         hoursSinceGeneration > 24;
}
```

**Testing Strategy**:
- Simulate major refactoring scenarios
- Test context freshness after package.json changes
- Validate session handoff with stale vs fresh context
- Document expected context refresh patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Claude sessions detect and warn about stale context
- Context automatically refreshes after architectural changes
- No accidental reverting of completed refactoring work
- Consistent system understanding across all sessions

### Clean Environment End-to-End Testing
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**Sprint**: Unassigned (was SPRINT-004)  
**Status**: Not Started

## Completed - Previous Sprint

### Legacy Context Migration to Production Server
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Complexity**: High  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Created**: 2025-08-04  
**Sprint**: SPRINT-003  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - SUPERSEDED BY MCP SERVER SEPARATION  

**Problem**: Legacy context data is stored in local `.contextmcp/sessions/` JSON files from the Socket.IO era. This data must be migrated to the production server before deprecating the legacy system. Migration must be non-destructive and verifiable to prevent context loss that could impact session quality.

**Business Impact**: 
- 14 active session files containing critical development context
- Session interruptions directly impact AI assistance quality
- After migration, ALL connections will be production-only
- Context loss would force developers to rebuild mental models

**Requirements**:
1. **Non-Destructive Migration**
   - Preserve all original JSON files as backup
   - Create rollback mechanism if migration fails
   - Validate data integrity at each step
   
2. **Verification Process**
   - Compare source and destination record counts
   - Validate all fields migrated correctly
   - Test session resumption with migrated data
   - Checksum verification for data integrity
   
3. **Session Continuity**
   - Minimize downtime during migration (< 5 minutes)
   - Handle active sessions gracefully
   - Preserve session relationships and metadata
   - Maintain temporal ordering of events

**Technical Design**:

```typescript
// Migration Script Structure
interface MigrationPlan {
  phases: [
    {
      name: "Discovery & Analysis",
      steps: [
        "Scan .contextmcp/sessions/ for all JSON files",
        "Parse and validate each session structure",
        "Generate migration manifest with checksums",
        "Identify active vs expired sessions"
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Pre-Migration Validation",
      steps: [
        "Test database connectivity",
        "Verify schema compatibility",
        "Create migration tables if needed",
        "Backup current production data"
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Migration Execution",
      steps: [
        "Transform JSON to database format",
        "Batch insert with transaction safety",
        "Update references and foreign keys",
        "Maintain audit trail"
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Verification & Testing",
      steps: [
        "Compare counts and checksums",
        "Test session retrieval APIs",
        "Verify context quality metrics",
        "Run integration tests"
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Cutover & Cleanup",
      steps: [
        "Update client configurations",
        "Deprecate Socket.IO endpoints",
        "Archive legacy files",
        "Monitor production stability"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Database Schema Mapping**:
```sql
-- Legacy JSON structure to new schema
.contextmcp/sessions/*.json ‚Üí sessions table
- id ‚Üí session_id (VARCHAR)
- userId ‚Üí user_id (UUID)
- teamId ‚Üí team_id (UUID)
- projectId ‚Üí project_id (UUID)
- workingDirectory ‚Üí metadata.working_directory
- currentTask ‚Üí metadata.current_task
- focusAreas ‚Üí metadata.focus_areas (JSONB)
- conversationSummary ‚Üí summary
- keyDecisions ‚Üí decisions (JSONB)
- recentFiles ‚Üí file_contexts (separate table)
- openTasks ‚Üí tasks (JSONB)
- metadata ‚Üí metadata (JSONB)
```

**Migration Script Location**: `scripts/migrate-legacy-context.ts`

**Verification Metrics**:
- Total sessions migrated: 14
- Data integrity score: 100%
- Session continuity maintained: YES
- Rollback tested: YES
- Production validation: PASS

**Risk Mitigation**:
1. **Data Loss**: Full backup before migration, transaction rollback capability
2. **Schema Mismatch**: Flexible JSONB fields for unmapped data
3. **Performance Impact**: Batch processing, off-peak execution
4. **Session Interruption**: Read-only mode during migration
5. **Rollback Failure**: Detailed audit log for manual recovery

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 14 session files successfully migrated
- [ ] Zero data loss (verified by checksums)
- [ ] Session resumption works with migrated data
- [ ] Production API serves migrated context
- [ ] Legacy Socket.IO server can be safely deprecated

## üìã Medium Priority Issues

### Session Handoff Template Enhancement for Human Continuity
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Created**: 2025-08-11  
**Story Points**: 5  

**Problem**: Current session handoffs are technically comprehensive but lack the human-centered continuity needed for natural collaboration across Claude sessions. They read more like technical documentation than a warm greeting between colleagues.

**Analysis**: The session handoff document structure prioritizes technical accuracy over emotional continuity. While it captures all necessary context, it doesn't convey the collaborative relationship and shared understanding between human and AI.

**Proposed Improvements**:

1. **Lead with Human Context**: Start with "Chris, yesterday we..." rather than technical status blocks
2. **Emotional Continuity**: Capture satisfaction of major wins ("we crushed that interface simplification!") and frustration points ("that SQL bug is stubborn")  
3. **Conversational Bridges**: Include phrases like "You were concerned about..." or "We decided to prioritize..." 
4. **Decision Rationale**: Brief context on *why* choices were made, not just what was done
5. **Momentum Indicators**: Clear signals for building mode vs debugging mode vs planning mode
6. **Rapport Restoration**: Template sections that help the new Claude feel like a trusted colleague continuing the conversation

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhance handoff template with rapport-focused sections
- Add conversational tone guidelines for handoff generation
- Include decision context and emotional state indicators
- Create mode-aware greeting templates
- Improve structure to feel less like documentation, more like colleague briefing

**Success Criteria**:
- Handoffs feel like continuing a conversation rather than starting over
- Reduced "context switching overhead" when resuming sessions
- Users report improved continuity and collaboration experience
- New Claude sessions demonstrate better understanding of shared history
- Time to productive work <30 seconds after handoff load

### MCP Tool Value Assessment: 3V Framework Analysis
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: High  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Created**: 2025-08-08  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Interface Simplified from 21 ‚Üí 5 tools)  
**Design Principle**: Customer value-first thinking over feature accumulation

**Context**: Apply our revised 3V methodology (Value, Viability, Vulnerability) to systematically assess all 21 MCP tools. Current state shows potential "analytics theater" and feature bloat - need evidence-based tool portfolio optimization.

**Scope**:
- **Evaluate each tool**: Apply "Critical", "Potentially Useful", or "Garbage" classification
- **Value Analysis**: So what? Does it add value, or is it just low-value noise?
- **Design Thinking**: Are we doing the right thing? How does this empower our users?
- **Usability Assessment**: Dead-simple to use, or finicky and error-inducing?
- **Improvement Opportunities**: How can we enhance non-Garbage tools?

**3V Framework Application**:
1. **VALUE**: What's the real user problem this solves? (not the feature)
2. **VIABILITY**: Do users actually use this? Do we have data/feedback?
3. **VULNERABILITY**: What assumptions about user needs might be wrong?

**Expected Deliverables**:
- **Tool Assessment Matrix**: All 21 tools categorized with rationale
- **MVP Tool List**: Validated value propositions and usage patterns
- **Improvement Roadmap**: Specific enhancements for viable tools
- **Deprecation Plan**: Safe removal strategy for "Garbage" tools
- **Action Plan**: Implementation strategy for MCP revision

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear evidence-based rationale for each tool's classification
- Validated user value propositions for MVP tools
- Measurable improvement criteria for enhanced tools
- Strategy to reduce feature complexity while increasing user empowerment

**Dependencies**:
- User feedback/analytics on tool usage
- Team activity data from recent sessions
- Customer interviews/feedback (if available)

### Investigate Best-Practices Data Structure and API Workflow
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Created**: 2025-08-04

**Problem**: Current best practices system stores practices as an array in the code with limited flexibility and no cross-team collaboration features.

**Requirements**:
- Each best practice should be an individual database record with full CRUD operations
- Add visibility settings: public (shareable across teams) vs private (team-only)
- Implement metrics and analytics for each practice:
  - Impact score (subjective team rating)
  - Time/tokens saved (estimated efficiency gains)
  - Stars/likes from team members
  - Adoption count (how many teams use this practice)
  - Usage frequency and effectiveness tracking
- Create API endpoints for best practice management
- Enable cross-pollination of high-performing practices between teams
- Add discovery system for popular/effective public practices

**Technical Considerations**:
- Database schema changes: migrate from array storage to individual records
- API design for practice CRUD operations
- Privacy and permission system for public/private practices
- Metrics collection and aggregation system
- Search and discovery algorithms for practice recommendations
- Migration strategy for existing team practices

**Success Metrics**:
- Teams can easily discover and adopt effective practices from other teams
- Measurable improvement in development efficiency through practice adoption
- Active contribution and rating of practices by team members
- Clear analytics on which practices provide the most value

**Related**:
- Current implementation: `src/best-practices.ts`
- Database structure: `src/database.ts` team_best_practices table
- API endpoints: `src/remote-server.ts` best practices handlers

## Re-enable MCP Authentication for Production Security

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Technical Debt - Temporarily Disabled  
**Created:** 2025-08-02  
**Context:** Authentication was temporarily disabled to fix MCP connection issues during rebrand

### Problem
MCP endpoints in remote server currently bypass authentication for local development. This creates a security gap and prevents proper user identification, usage tracking, and plan enforcement.

### Current State
```typescript
// Authentication middleware for MCP API routes (disabled for local dev)
// this.app.use('/api/mcp', this.authManager.createAuthMiddleware());

// Fallback user object when auth is disabled
const user = req.user as AuthenticatedUser || {
  planTier: 'enterprise',
  planStatus: 'active', 
  organizationId: 'local-dev',
  id: 'local-user',
  email: 'dev@localhost'
};
```

### Solution Design

#### 1. Environment-Based Authentication
```typescript
private setupMCPAuthentication() {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    // Require full authentication in production
    this.app.use('/api/mcp', this.authManager.createAuthMiddleware());
  } else {
    // Optional authentication in development
    this.app.use('/api/mcp', this.authManager.createOptionalAuthMiddleware());
  }
}
```

#### 2. MCP Client Authentication
```typescript
// Add authentication headers to MCP client
class SimpleRemoteMCPClient {
  private apiKey?: string;
  
  constructor() {
    this.apiKey = process.env.CONTEXTMCP_API_KEY || process.env.MCP_API_KEY;
  }
  
  private getAuthHeaders() {
    return this.apiKey ? { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}` } : {};
  }
}
```

#### 3. Development vs Production Flow
- **Development**: Optional auth with fallback user object
- **Production**: Required API key authentication
- **Local MCP Client**: Use environment variables for auth credentials

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create `createOptionalAuthMiddleware()` method
- [ ] Add environment-based auth switching
- [ ] Update MCP client to send auth headers
- [ ] Add API key generation endpoint for local development
- [ ] Update deployment configuration with auth requirements
- [ ] Test authentication flow in both environments

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ~~MCP endpoints work without auth in local development~~ ‚úÖ Currently working
- [ ] MCP endpoints require auth in production deployment
- [ ] Local MCP client can authenticate with API key
- [ ] Usage tracking works with proper user identification
- [ ] Plan enforcement works correctly
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment of auth changes

## File System Watching for Live Development Sync

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Designed, Not Implemented

### Overview
Enable real-time context updates as developers edit files locally, without needing git commits. This feature will monitor file system changes and automatically sync context updates to the team.

### Architecture

#### Core Components

**1. File Watcher Service**
```typescript
class FileSystemWatcher {
  - Uses chokidar for cross-platform file watching
  - Monitors project directories for changes
  - Debounces rapid changes (e.g., IDE auto-saves)
  - Filters out ignored paths (.git, node_modules, etc.)
}
```

**2. Change Aggregator**
```typescript
class ChangeAggregator {
  - Batches multiple file changes within time window (500ms)
  - Categorizes changes: add/modify/delete
  - Determines update scope: incremental vs structural
  - Prevents duplicate updates
}
```

**3. Local Agent**
```typescript
class LocalContextAgent {
  - Runs on developer's machine
  - Watches configured project directories
  - Establishes WebSocket connection to remote server
  - Sends aggregated changes to server

{
  "watch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "paths": ["src", "lib"],
    "ignore": ["**/*.log", "**/dist/**"],
    "debounceMs": 500,
    "batchWindowMs": 1000
  }
}
```

## Context Size vs Work Output Analytics

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Not Started

### Overview
Build comprehensive analytics system to study the correlation between Claude's context size and actual work performed. This research will help optimize AI coding workflows, guide users on when to start fresh sessions, and provide valuable insights for product improvement.

### Research Questions
- **Context Efficiency**: Does larger context always lead to better code quality?
- **Diminishing Returns**: At what context size do additional tokens stop improving output?
- **Rework Patterns**: Does context bloat correlate with more iterations and corrections?
- **Quality Correlations**: How does context size relate to code complexity, test coverage, and bug density?
- **Session Optimization**: When should users capture session state and start fresh?

### Metrics to Track

**Context Growth Indicators:**
- Estimated context size (tokens/characters in conversations)
- Context complexity (number of files referenced, tools used)
- Session duration and interaction patterns
- Context "drift" detection (topic changes, scope expansion)

**Work Output Metrics:**
```typescript
interface WorkOutputMetrics {
  linesOfCodeAdded: number;
  linesOfCodeRemoved: number;
  linesOfCodeModified: number;
  filesCreated: number;
  filesModified: number;
  filesDeleted: number;
  testsWritten: number;
  refactoringEvents: number;
  bugFixEvents: number;
  featureCompletions: number;
}
```

**Quality Indicators:**
- Code complexity changes (cyclomatic complexity)
- Test coverage delta
- Error/exception handling improvements
- Documentation quality (comments, README updates)
- Build/test success rates
- Time between iterations (indicates rework)

**User Experience Metrics:**
- Session satisfaction scores
- Context handoff success rates
- Time to first working code
- Developer flow state indicators

### Architecture Design

**Data Collection Layer:**
```typescript
class ContextAnalyticsCollector {
  // Track context growth proxy metrics
  async trackContextGrowth(sessionId: string, metrics: {
    estimatedTokens: number;
    toolsUsed: string[];
    filesReferenced: string[];
    topicShifts: number;
  }): Promise<void>;
  
  // Analyze git diffs for work output
  async analyzeWorkOutput(commitHash: string): Promise<WorkOutputMetrics>;
  
  // Code quality analysis
  async assessCodeQuality(files: string[]): Promise<QualityMetrics>;
}
```

**Statistical Analysis Engine:**
```typescript
class ContextCorrelationAnalyzer {
  // Find patterns across user sessions
  async analyzeContextEfficiency(timeframe: string): Promise<{
    optimalContextRange: [number, number];
    diminishingReturnsThreshold: number;
    qualityCorrelations: CorrelationMatrix;
  }>;
  
  // Identify session restart recommendations
  async generateSessionAdvice(currentContext: ContextMetrics): Promise<{
    shouldRestart: boolean;
    reason: string;
    confidenceScore: number;
  }>;
}
```

### Privacy & Data Collection

**Anonymous Aggregation:**
- No personally identifiable information stored
- Code content never analyzed, only structural metrics
- Opt-in participation with clear data usage policies
- Aggregate statistics only, individual sessions not identifiable

**Data Points (Anonymized):**
```typescript
interface AnonymousSessionData {
  sessionId: string; // Hash-based, non-reversible
  organizationTier: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
  projectType: string; // Language, framework detected
  contextMetrics: ContextGrowthData;
  outputMetrics: WorkOutputMetrics;

## Session Display Optimization: Prevent Claude Code Summarization

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Not Started

### Overview
Improve session list display to prevent Claude Code from automatically summarizing the results. Currently, `list_sessions` returns all sessions correctly from the database, but Claude Code condenses the output (e.g., showing 4 sessions in summary instead of displaying all 7 available sessions).

### Problem Statement
**Current Behavior**: 
- Server returns complete session menu with 7 sessions
- Claude Code sees long response and summarizes to ~4 sessions
- Users lose visibility into all available sessions
- Defeats the "restaurant menu" UX design

**Desired Behavior**:
- Show all available sessions without summarization
- Maintain clean, scannable format
- Preserve copy/paste functionality for resume commands

### Solution Options

**Option 1: Compact Single-Line Format**
```
1. BUG-001 resolution (5h, 85%) ‚Üí `resume_session sessionId="..."`
2. Website completion (9h, 85%) ‚Üí `resume_session sessionId="..."`
3. SaaS architecture (24h, 85%) ‚Üí `resume_session sessionId="..."`
```

**Option 2: Pagination System**
```
# Session Menu üìã (Page 1 of 2)

Showing sessions 1-5 of 7:
[Current format for first 5 sessions]

üí° Use `list_sessions page=2` to see more sessions
```

**Option 3: Shorter Descriptions**
- Truncate session titles to 30-40 characters max
- Remove verbose descriptions that trigger summarization
- Focus on essential info: task, time, quality, resume command

**Option 4: Adaptive Display**
- 1-5 sessions: Full format (current)
- 6-10 sessions: Compact format
- 11+ sessions: Paginated format

### Implementation Considerations

**Technical**:
- Modify `listSessions()` method in `remote-server.ts`
- Add pagination support to database queries
- Implement format switching logic based on session count

**UX**:
- Maintain copy/paste friendly resume commands
- Keep quality percentages visible for decision making
- Preserve chronological ordering (most recent first)

**Performance**:
- Limit database queries to reasonable page sizes
- Cache session counts for pagination logic
- Consider session archiving for very large lists

### Success Metrics
- Users can see all available sessions without manual expansion
- No information loss due to Claude Code summarization
- Maintained or improved session resume success rate
- Positive developer feedback on session discoverability

### Dependencies
- No external dependencies
- Compatible with existing session infrastructure
- Works with current database schema

## Vibe Check: Best Practices Reminder Tool

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** Ginko tool for Claude Code  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Created:** 2025-08-04

### Overview
Create a "vibecheck" command that alerts Claude to remember and adhere to best practices during coding sessions.

### Problem Statement
During coding sessions, Claude has to decide between quick progress and strict development hygiene. Sometimes it is more efficient to work through trial and error to debug a localized problem, then apply discipline to get the solution into compliance with team standards. However, if the trial-and-error behavior goes on too long, discipline can slip and the project ends up with regressions and temporary fixes that aren't sustainable long term.

### Solution Design
Implement a `vibecheck` command similar to `list_sessions` or `capture_session` that:
- Reminds Claude to apply best practices to problem solving and code
- Analyzes current session for potential technical debt accumulation
- Provides contextual reminders based on recent actions
- Suggests refactoring or cleanup tasks if needed

### Implementation Details

**Command Structure:**
```typescript
interface VibeCheckResponse {
  sessionQuality: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'needs-attention' | 'concerning';
  practicesApplied: string[];
  practicesMissed: string[];
  technicalDebt: {
    area: string;
    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    suggestion: string;
  }[];
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

**Trigger Scenarios:**
- After multiple failed attempts at the same task
- When temporary fixes accumulate beyond threshold
- At regular intervals during long sessions
- Before major commits or PR creation
- On explicit user request

**Integration Points:**
- Hooks into existing best practices system
- Analyzes recent file changes and patterns
- Reviews git diff for code quality indicators
- Checks test coverage and error handling

### User Experience

**Sample Output:**
```
üéØ Vibe Check Results

Session Quality: Good (78%)

‚úÖ Practices Applied:
- Understanding code before implementing
- Proper error handling
- Following existing patterns

‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement:
- 3 TODO comments added without tickets
- Test coverage decreased by 5%
- Repeated trial-and-error in auth module

üí° Recommendations:
1. Refactor authentication error handling before proceeding
2. Add tests for newly added utility functions
3. Document the workaround in processWebhook() 

Would you like me to help address any of these items?
```

**Command Variations:**
- `vibecheck` - Full analysis of current session
- `vibecheck --quick` - Brief reminder of key practices
- `vibecheck --area=<module>` - Focus on specific code area
- `vibecheck --auto` - Enable automatic periodic checks

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in technical debt accumulation
- Improved code quality metrics over session duration
- Fewer post-session cleanup requirements
- Positive developer feedback on timing and relevance
- Measurable improvement in best practice adherence

### Technical Considerations
- Lightweight performance impact
- Non-intrusive notifications
- Contextual awareness of current task
- Integration with existing analytics
- Configurable thresholds and preferences
