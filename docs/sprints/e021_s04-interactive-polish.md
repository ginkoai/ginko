### Task 2: Halftone/Dot Matrix Animation

- [ ] Canvas or CSS implementation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Color variations per page

### Task 3: ASCII Founder Photo Reveal

- [ ] ASCII → photo transition
- [ ] On-brand for dev audience
- [ ] Test with actual photos

### Task 4: Microinteractions

- [ ] Link underline animations
- [ ] Copy button feedback
- [ ] Nav menu transitions

### Task 5: Footer Treatment
- [ ] iykyg logo animation
- [ ] Final CTA card styling
- [ ] Tree-structure navigation (Hiro-style)
- [ ] Dark footer with proper contrast

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 2-3 signature interactions implemented
- [ ] Interactions feel natural, not gimmicky
- [ ] Performance acceptable (no jank)
- [ ] Footer complete with iykyg treatment
- [ ] Full page prototype ready for review

## Notes

This sprint is about the details that make people remember the site. "Delighters" not "distractors." Every animation should have a purpose or create a moment of joy.
