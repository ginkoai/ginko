# Sprint 008 - Session Handoff Enhancement & Dashboard Live Data

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Restore the emotional continuity and collegiality in session handoffs while implementing live dashboard data  
**Duration**: 1 day (standard sprint)

## 🎯 Sprint Planning

### Backlog Items Selected
1. **[FEATURE-001] Restore Emotional Context in Handoff Templates** (5 story points) - Find original templates and restore collegiality that was lost during template consolidation
2. **[SESSION-UX] Human-Readable Template Review Format** (3 story points) - Format handoff templates as markdown for human review, then reformat for server upload
3. **[DASHBOARD-001] Replace FPO Data with Live Metrics** (5 story points) - Connect dashboard to real API endpoints and user data

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Session handoffs feel warm and collegial like "Good morning, Chris!" examples
- [ ] Users can easily read and approve handoff templates in markdown format  
- [ ] Dashboard shows real user sessions, analytics, and team activity instead of placeholder data
- [ ] All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing systems
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect template improvements

## 🏃 Sprint Execution

### Day Start
- **Time**: 9:30 AM
- **Context Loaded**: Yes (via /start command)
- **Previous Session**: Auto-resumed from enhanced handoff system

### Work Completed

#### Task 1: [FEATURE-001] Restore Emotional Context in Handoff Templates
**Status**: 🚧 In Progress  
**Time Spent**: 0h 30m  
**Story Points**: 5  

**What was done**:
- Located original handoff templates with emotional context patterns
- Identified key files: `test-mode-simulation.js`, original BACKLOG.md examples
- Found specific rapport patterns like "Good morning, Chris! 🚀", "Ready to crush this bug?"
- Analyzed current session-handoff.ts implementation vs original vision

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Original Vision (from test-mode-simulation.js):
const rapportGreetings = {
  debugging: "Ready to crush this bug? 🔧",
  building: "Ready to build something awesome? 🏗️",
  shipping: "Ready to ship this masterpiece? 🚀"
};

// Current Implementation (too generic):
const closings: Record<SessionMode, string> = {
  debugging: hasBlockers ? "Let's resolve this." : "Let's fix this.",
  building: "Let's build.",
  shipping: "Let's ship it."
};
```

**Next Steps**:
- Restore the energetic, specific mode-based greetings
- Add back shared accomplishment context ("We've completed 3 tasks together")
- Implement proper rapport-building language

---

#### Task 2: [SESSION-UX] Human-Readable Template Review Format
**Status**: 🚧 Pending  
**Time Spent**: 0h 0m  
**Story Points**: 3  

**Planned Approach**:
- Create markdown formatter for handoff template preview
- Implement dual-format system: markdown for human review, structured for server
- Add template approval workflow

---

#### Task 3: [DASHBOARD-001] Replace FPO Data with Live Metrics  
**Status**: 🚧 Pending  
**Time Spent**: 0h 0m  
**Story Points**: 5  

**Planned Approach**:
- Audit current dashboard components for FPO data
- Connect to real API endpoints for sessions, analytics, team activity
- Implement graceful empty states for new users

## 🐛 Issues & Blockers

*No blockers identified yet*

## 📝 Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Restore Original Rapport Templates vs Incremental Enhancement
- **Context**: Found significant regression in handoff emotional continuity
- **Options Considered**: 
  1. Incremental fixes to current templates - Less risky but maintains bland tone
  2. Restore original rapport-focused templates - Higher impact but more work
- **Decision**: Restore original templates with full emotional context
- **Impact**: Better user experience and colleague-like continuity

## 🔄 Code Changes Summary

### Files to Modify
- `packages/mcp-server/src/session-handoff.ts` - Restore rapport context generation
- `src/session-handoff.ts` - Main implementation updates
- Dashboard components - Replace FPO with live data connections

### Pull Requests
*To be created as work progresses*

## 📚 Learnings & Insights

### Technical Learnings
1. **Template Consolidation Risk**: Merging templates can lose essential emotional context
   - **Application**: Always preserve user experience elements during refactoring

### Process Improvements  
1. **Sprint Planning with /vibecheck**: Using collaborative commands improves focus
   - **Action**: Continue using slash commands for sprint discipline
