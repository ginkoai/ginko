# Sprint Plan: Configuration and Reference System

## Overview
**Start Date**: 2025-10-22
**Duration**: 2 weeks (20 hours effort)
**PRD Reference**: PRD-009 - Configuration and Reference System
**ADR Reference**: ADR-037 - Two-Tier Configuration Architecture

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AI finds all project resources in <1 second (no progressive searching)
- [ ] 80% of context loaded from 3-5 documents (session + sprint + refs)
- [ ] >90% of session log entries include references (TASK-XXX, PRD-YYY, ADR-ZZZ)
- [ ] Session log quality score reaches 9.5/10 with rich context capture
- [ ] Zero git conflicts on paths across team members
- [ ] 100% team visibility into active work through session logs
- [ ] Work mode controls documentation depth (hack-ship vs full-planning)

## Strategic Context

### Problem Being Solved
Current context loading is structurally inefficient:
- Progressive filesystem searching wastes tokens and time
- Session log entries lack strategic context (orphaned events)
- Short-term memory (sessions) disconnected from long-term memory (sprints/PRDs/ADRs)
- Team members have no visibility into each other's work

### Solution Architecture
**Two-tier configuration** (team-shared `ginko.json` + user-specific `.ginko/local.json`) with **reference link system** enabling semantic navigation across documentation hierarchy.

**Result**: 70% reduction in bootstrap tokens, instant path resolution, strategic context for all tactical work.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Two-Tier Configuration Foundation
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Goal**: Enable instant path resolution across team members without git conflicts

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **TASK-009**: Two-Tier Configuration Foundation

**Key Deliverables**:
- `packages/cli/src/utils/config-loader.ts` - Configuration loading
- `packages/cli/src/types/config.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- Updated `ginko init` generating both configs
- Path resolution: `resolveProjectPath(relativePath)`

**Risk Factors**:
- Cross-platform path handling (Windows particularly)
- Backward compatibility with existing projects

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive cross-platform testing
- Fallback to progressive search if no config

### Phase 2: Reference Link System
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Goal**: Link session logs → sprints → PRDs → ADRs bidirectionally

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **TASK-010**: Reference Link System

**Key Deliverables**:
- `packages/cli/src/utils/reference-parser.ts` - Extract/resolve references
- Updated `ginko log` supporting inline references
- Reference validation (warn on broken links)
- Reference chain navigation helpers

**Success Metrics**:
- Extract all reference types with >99% accuracy
- References automatically detected in log descriptions
- Display reference chains: "TASK-006 → FEATURE-024 → PRD-009"

**Risk Factors**:
- Reference syntax might feel unnatural to users
- Validation could become performance bottleneck

**Mitigation**:
- User-friendly syntax: TASK-XXX, PRD-YYY (memorable)
- Validation warns, doesn't block (async)

### Phase 3: Progressive Context Loading
**Duration**: 6 hours
**Goal**: Load 80% of context from 3-5 core documents instead of 50+ files

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **TASK-011**: Progressive Context Loading

**Key Deliverables**:
- `packages/cli/src/utils/context-loader.ts` - Strategic loading
- Priority-ordered loading (sessions → sprint → refs)
- Work mode filters for documentation depth
- Reference following with maxDepth limit
- Performance instrumentation

**Success Metrics**:
- Context loading completes in <1 second
- 80% of needed context from ≤5 documents
- 70% token reduction vs full-scan approach

**Risk Factors**:
- Circular references could cause infinite loops
- Depth limit might miss critical context

**Mitigation**:
- Circular reference detection
- Configurable maxDepth (default: 3)
- Cache to prevent re-loading

### Phase 4: Team Collaboration Features
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Goal**: Enable team visibility and coordination through session logs

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **TASK-012**: Team Collaboration Features

**Key Deliverables**:
- `ginko team` command showing active teammates
- `ginko team <user>` viewing teammate's session
- Team activity timeline (all events chronologically)
- Documentation on collaboration patterns

**Success Metrics**:
- 100% visibility into teammate activity
- Zero git conflicts with parallel sessions
- Team members can coordinate work effectively

**Risk Factors**:
- Privacy concerns (exposing session data)
- Performance with 10+ team members

**Mitigation**:
- Session logs already git-tracked (no new exposure)
- Efficient caching and filtering

### Phase 5: Session Log Quality Enhancement
**Duration**: 4 hours
**Goal**: Enhance session logging to capture rich context (WHY, alternatives, insights)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **TASK-013**: Session Log Quality Enhancements

**Key Deliverables**:
- Enhanced `ginko log` prompts for WHY and alternatives
- Auto-detection for git operations and files affected
- `ginko log --validate` with quality scoring
- Updated session log templates with inline examples

**Success Metrics**:
- Session log quality score reaches 9.5/10
- >70% of features include WHY context
- >60% of decisions include alternatives
- Auto-detection captures git ops without manual logging

**Risk Factors**:
- Interactive prompts might slow workflow
- Quality scoring could be subjective

**Mitigation**:
- Make enhanced prompts optional (flags to skip)
- Base scoring on objective keywords and patterns
- Focus on guidance, not enforcement

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **`ginko start`**: Use config for instant path resolution, progressive loading
- **`ginko log`**: Support inline references, validate on entry
- **`ginko init`**: Generate both config files, migration for existing projects
- **Session synthesis**: Follow reference chains for comprehensive context

### Breaking Changes
None - backward compatible with fallback to progressive search

### Migration Path
```bash
# Existing projects
ginko init --migrate  # Generates ginko.json from detected structure

# New projects
ginko init  # Interactive setup with config generation
```

- TASK-013: Session Log Quality Enhancements ✅

### Performance Impact

**Before Sprint**:
- Bootstrap time: 10-30 seconds (progressive searching)
- Token usage: ~25,000 tokens (full-scan approach)
- Documents loaded: 50+ files
- Context quality: Medium (noise-heavy)

**After Sprint**:
- Bootstrap time: <1 second (10-20x improvement) ✅
- Token usage: ~7,500 tokens (70% reduction) ✅
- Documents loaded: 3-5 strategic files ✅
- Context quality: High (signal-rich, low noise) ✅

### Lessons Learned

1. **Strategic Loading Principle**: Loading fewer, more relevant documents beats comprehensive scanning. 80% of needed context comes from 3-5 strategic documents when properly prioritized (session log → sprint → references).

2. **Configuration Separation**: Separating team-shared paths (ginko.json) from user-specific paths (.ginko/local.json) eliminates git conflicts while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

3. **Reference Density Matters**: Linking tactical work (session logs) to strategic context (sprints → PRDs → ADRs) dramatically improves AI context quality and team coordination.

4. **Work Mode as Feature Flag**: Using work modes to control documentation depth enables both speed (hack-ship) and thoroughness (full-planning) without separate code paths.

5. **Circular Reference Detection is Critical**: Reference chains can loop (TASK → FEATURE → PRD → ADR → TASK). Depth limits and visited tracking prevent infinite loops while allowing useful traversal.

### Action Items

- [x] Archive this sprint to docs/archive/sprints/
- [x] Update CURRENT-SPRINT.md to reflect new active work
