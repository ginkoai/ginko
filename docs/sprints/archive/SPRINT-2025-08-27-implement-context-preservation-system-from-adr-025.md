# Sprint Plan: Implement Context Preservation System from ADR-025

## Overview
**Start Date**: 2025-08-27
**Duration**: 5 days
**ADR Reference**: ADR-025 - Context Preservation System Architecture
**PRD Reference**: PRD-2025-08-27 - Context Preservation System

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Context capture completes in <2 seconds with "done" response
- [ ] Context modules load progressively based on working directory
- [ ] AI enhancement adds value without breaking flow (exit code handling)
- [ ] All commands follow Flow State Philosophy (ADR-023)
- [ ] 100% local execution, no network calls required
- [ ] Git integration tracks all context changes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Duration**: 1 day
**Goal**: Establish core context module infrastructure and storage system

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `ginko load [pattern]` command (~2 hours)
- [ ] Create context module index management (~1.5 hours)
- [ ] Build usage statistics tracking (~1 hour)
- [ ] Implement module dependency resolution (~1.5 hours)

**Deliverables**:
- Working `load` command that reads context modules
- Index.json catalog with search capability
- Basic usage tracking for relevance scoring

**Risk Factors**:
- Existing capture command integration complexity
- File system permissions on different platforms

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
**Duration**: 2 days
**Goal**: Build intelligent context discovery and auto-loading system

**Tasks**:
Day 2:
- [ ] Implement `ginko context auto` for directory-based discovery (~3 hours)
- [ ] Create relevance scoring algorithm (~2 hours)
- [ ] Build progressive loading (core → expanded → deep) (~1 hour)

Day 3:
- [ ] Integrate auto-discovery with `ginko start` (~2 hours)
- [ ] Implement `ginko context prune` for maintenance (~2 hours)
- [ ] Add context extraction to handoff command (~2 hours)

**Deliverables**:
- Auto-discovery working based on current directory
- Progressive loading with three depth levels
- Context extraction during handoffs
- Pruning system for stale modules

**Risk Factors**:
- Pattern matching performance with large codebases
- Balancing auto-loading vs overwhelming with context

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement
**Duration**: 2 days
**Goal**: Ensure system reliability, performance, and user experience

**Tasks**:
Day 4:
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for context commands (~3 hours)
- [ ] Performance testing with 100+ modules (~1.5 hours)
- [ ] Fix stderr/stdout issue in explore/architecture/plan (~1 hour)
- [ ] Document context module best practices (~0.5 hours)

Day 5:
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing (explore→architecture→plan→capture) (~2 hours)
- [ ] Create example context modules for common patterns (~2 hours)
- [ ] Update README with context preservation features (~1 hour)
- [ ] Final performance optimization and cleanup (~1 hour)

**Deliverables**:
- Full test coverage for context system
- Performance benchmarks documented
- User documentation and examples
- Bug fixes for UX issues

**Risk Factors**:
- Edge cases in file system operations
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

## Dependencies
- **Already in place**: CLI framework, capture command, AI enhancement pattern
- **Technical prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, git installed
- **External dependencies**: None (fully local system)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each command tested independently, mocked file system
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow from capture to load to prune
- **Manual Testing**: Real project usage, various directory structures
- **Performance Testing**: Load times with 10, 50, 100, 500 modules

## Rollback Plan
If implementation fails or causes issues:
1. Disable auto-loading with environment variable
2. Fall back to manual `ginko context add` commands
3. Keep basic capture without module system
4. All context modules remain as readable markdown

## Daily Standup Topics

**Day 1** (Foundation):
- Focus: Build load command and index system
- Check: Can load specific modules by pattern?
- Risk: Storage structure might need revision

**Day 2** (Auto-Discovery):
- Focus: Implement intelligent context discovery
- Check: Does auto-discovery find relevant modules?
- Risk: Pattern matching performance

**Day 3** (Integration):
- Focus: Wire up with existing commands
- Check: Does ginko start auto-suggest context?
- Risk: Too much or too little context loading

**Day 4** (Testing):
- Focus: Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- Check: All tests passing? Performance acceptable?
- Risk: Unknown edge cases discovered

**Day 5** (Polish):
- Focus: Documentation and user experience
- Check: Full workflow smooth? Examples clear?
- Risk: Last-minute integration issues

## Time Budget
- **Total Days**: 5
- **Coding Hours**: ~30 (6 hours/day accounting for overhead)
- **Core Features**: 18 hours (60%)
- **Testing**: 8 hours (27%)
- **Documentation**: 4 hours (13%)

## Success Metrics for Sprint Review
- [ ] Demo: Create context module, switch directories, auto-load relevant context
- [ ] Performance: All commands complete in target times
- [ ] Quality: Zero critical bugs, all tests passing
- [ ] Documentation: Clear examples for each feature
- [ ] User Value: Measurable reduction in context recovery time

## Next Sprint Considerations
- Git hook integration for automatic context updates
- Team pattern aggregation across repositories
- Visual context map in dashboard
- Context sharing via Ginko server (optional)
