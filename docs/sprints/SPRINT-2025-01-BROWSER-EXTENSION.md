# Sprint: Browser Extension Phase 1 - Foundation & Discovery

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint ID**: SPRINT-2025-01-BE-PHASE1  
**Duration**: 2 Sessions (estimated 4-6 hours)  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Status**: PLANNED  
**Goal**: Validate technical feasibility and establish foundation for browser extension

## Sprint Objectives
1. Create minimal working Chrome extension
2. Validate Claude.ai compatibility (CSP, detection)
3. Establish sidebar architecture
4. Implement basic session tracking
5. Document learnings and blockers

## Session 1: Technical Proof of Concept
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Focus**: Extension foundation and Claude.ai detection

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up Chrome extension development environment
- [ ] Create manifest.json v3 with required permissions
- [ ] Implement basic popup/sidebar structure
- [ ] Build Claude.ai tab detection logic
- [ ] Test CSP compatibility with Claude.ai
- [ ] Create basic message passing between content script and sidebar
- [ ] Document any blocking issues discovered

### Deliverables
- Working Chrome extension that loads in developer mode
- Sidebar panel that appears when Claude.ai is active
- Documentation of CSP findings and workarounds
- Basic project structure established

### Success Criteria
- Extension loads without errors
- Can detect when user is on Claude.ai
- Sidebar panel renders correctly
- No CSP violations preventing functionality

## Session 2: User Action Capture
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Focus**: Core user interactions and data persistence

### Tasks
- [ ] Add "Start Session" and "End Session" buttons
- [ ] Implement session timer functionality
- [ ] Create basic handoff template (browser-optimized)
- [ ] Implement chrome.storage.local for session data
- [ ] Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
- [ ] Test data persistence across browser restarts
- [ ] Create basic UI/UX for sidebar

### Deliverables
- Functional session management buttons
- Working timer that tracks session duration
- Template system with copy functionality
- Persistent storage of session data
- Clean, usable sidebar interface

### Success Criteria
- Users can start/stop sessions manually
- Timer accurately tracks session duration
- Templates copy to clipboard successfully
- Data persists between browser sessions
- UI is intuitive and responsive

## Review Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Technical Feasibility
**After Session 1**
- Can we reliably detect and track Claude sessions?
- Are there any CSP or technical blockers?
- Is the sidebar approach viable?
- What unexpected challenges emerged?

### Checkpoint 2: Core Workflow Validation
**After Session 2**
- Can users complete the basic workflow?
- Does manual triggering feel natural?
- Is the data persistence reliable?
- Are we ready to proceed to Phase 2?

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **CSP Blocking**: Claude.ai may prevent extension functionality
   - Mitigation: Sidebar-only approach, no DOM manipulation
   
2. **User Confusion**: Manual triggers may feel unnatural
   - Mitigation: Clear UI with helpful prompts
   
3. **Data Loss**: Browser storage limitations
   - Mitigation: Regular backups, size monitoring
   
4. **Performance**: Extension may slow browser
   - Mitigation: Efficient code, lazy loading

## Test & Learn Questions
- What CSP restrictions does Claude.ai enforce?
- How do users react to manual session management?
- What's the optimal sidebar width/layout?
- Are there any browser-specific issues?
- How much data can we store locally?

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed for both sessions
- [ ] Code committed to feature branch
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings
- [ ] Review checkpoints assessed
- [ ] Decision made on Phase 2 continuation
- [ ] Any blockers documented with workarounds

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Planning)
Based on Phase 1 learnings:
1. Refine technical approach if needed
2. Plan template system implementation
3. Design metrics collection strategy
4. Prepare for conversation analysis features

## Notes
- Keep extension minimal in Phase 1
- Focus on learning and validation
- Document everything for team knowledge
- Prioritize ToS compliance throughout
- Consider user privacy from the start
