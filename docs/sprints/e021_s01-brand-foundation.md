# Sprint e021_s01: Brand Foundation

## Sprint Goal

Establish the CSS foundation for the rebrand - colors, typography, spacing, and core component patterns. This becomes the "design system in code" that all iterations build on.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Create `website/rebrand/` directory structure
- [ ] Set up base HTML template with font loading
- [ ] Create `variables.css` with all color tokens
- [ ] Create `typography.css` with Instrument Serif + JetBrains Mono

### Task 2: Color System
- [ ] Define primary palette (sunset gradient)
- [ ] Define semantic colors (text, backgrounds, accents)
- [ ] Create light mode defaults
- [ ] Create dark mode overrides
- [ ] Test color contrast for accessibility

### Task 3: Typography Scale
- [ ] Define heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- [ ] Define body text styles
- [ ] Define code/mono styles
- [ ] Define caption/label styles
- [ ] Test readability at various sizes

### Task 4: Core Components
- [ ] Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost)
- [ ] Terminal/code blocks with corner brackets
- [ ] Dot grid background pattern
- [ ] Section dividers
- [ ] Badge/tag styles

### Task 5: Signature Elements
- [ ] Sunset stripe component (horizontal bands)
- [ ] iykyg footer logo treatment (light + dark)
- [ ] Ginkgo leaf integration patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All colors defined as CSS custom properties
- [ ] Typography renders correctly with fallbacks
- [ ] Components work in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Pattern library HTML page showing all elements
- [ ] Chris reviews foundation before Sprint 2

## Notes

This sprint is about establishing the vocabulary, not the sentences. Get the pieces right so iterations go fast.
