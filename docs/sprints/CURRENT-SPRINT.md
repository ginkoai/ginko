## Ready for New Sprint

All previous work completed and archived. Ready to define and start new sprint goals.

## Future Sprint Candidates

Potential upcoming sprints (planning phase):
- Browser Extension (SPRINT-2025-01-BROWSER-EXTENSION.md)
- Q1 Monetization Platform (SPRINT-2025-Q1-monetization-platform.md)
- Phase 1 Planning (sprint-plan-phase-1.md)

## How This Works

When a sprint becomes active:
1. Move/copy the sprint plan to docs/sprints/SPRINT-YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
2. Update this file to reference it: `See: SPRINT-YYYY-MM-DD-name.md`
3. The synthesis loader will pick up the active sprint automatically
4. When complete, add retrospective and archive to docs/sprints/archive/

When working from backlog only (like now):
- This file serves as the placeholder
- `ginko start` synthesis will fall back to loading active backlog items
- Work remains visible through session logs and git history

## Session Log Integration

Even without a sprint, context is maintained through:
- **Session logs**: `.ginko/sessions/{user}/current-session-log.md`
- **Backlog items**: Referenced via TASK-XXX, FEATURE-XXX in session logs
- **Strategic loading**: Context loader follows references automatically

---

*This file exists to prevent `ginko start` from loading stale sprint context. When a sprint is active, update this file to point to it.*
