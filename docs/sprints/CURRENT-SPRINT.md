**Focus:** Homepage polish based on Chris's review

---

## Tasks

### 1. NPM CLI Install Button (Menu)
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

**Problem:** "GET STARTED" in menu is generic - Chris wants the npm install command prominently displayed.

**Solution:** Replace GET STARTED with an npm install button/badge that copies `npm install -g @ginkoai/cli` to clipboard.

**Deliverable:** Mockup for approval, then implementation.

---

### 2. Remove VIEW DOCS and FIX IT NOW Buttons
**Status:** [x] Complete

**Problem:** These buttons add clutter without clear purpose.

**Solution:** Remove both buttons from the homepage.

---

### 3. Social Proof Section
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

**Problem:** Homepage needs credibility signals.

**Solution:** Create/replace social proof section or separator. Consider: testimonials, user counts, company logos, or stats.

---

### 4. Discord Promotion Section
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

**Problem:** Ginko wants to drive Discord community activity.

**Solution:** Create a section that promotes Discord with clear CTA to join.

---

### 5. Rainbow Separator Above Footer
**Status:** [x] Complete

**Problem:** Footer transition needs visual interest.

**Solution:** Add rainbow gradient separator above footer (matches rebrand aesthetic).

---

### 6. Simplified Footer with Final CTA
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

**Problem:** Current footer has too many links, needs stronger closing CTA.

**Solution:** Reduce footer links, add prominent final CTA (likely npm install or sign up).

---

### 7. Features Card Carousel
**Status:** [ ] Not Started
**Blocked:** Waiting for inspiration screenshots

**Problem:** Features section needs a new treatment.

**Solution:** Create a stack of cards that can be sorted through using `< . . . . . . . >` navigation below.

**Deliverable:** Mockup for Chris's review first.
