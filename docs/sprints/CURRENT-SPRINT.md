# Current Sprint Status

**Status**: No active sprint
**Mode**: Backlog-driven ad-hoc work
**Updated**: 2025-10-24

## Current Work

Working directly from backlog items rather than a structured sprint. Current focus areas:

### In Progress

- **TASK-017**: Audit and archive completed sprints, create CURRENT-SPRINT.md
  - Status: Active
  - Priority: High
  - Context: Cleaning up stale sprint context to fix `ginko start` loading issues

- **FEATURE-022**: Implement OAuth integration
  - Status: In progress (minimal detail, likely stale)
  - Priority: High
  - Size: L

### Recent Completions

- **TASK-016**: Enhanced feature (recently completed)
- **TASK-009 through TASK-013**: Configuration and Reference System sprint
  - All tasks completed successfully
  - Sprint archived: SPRINT-2025-10-22-configuration-system.md
  - See: docs/sprints/archive/SPRINT-2025-10-22-configuration-system.md

## Why No Active Sprint?

Currently operating in maintenance and cleanup mode:
1. Addressing technical debt
2. Fixing context loading issues
3. Cleaning up stale documentation
4. Preparing infrastructure for future sprints

## Future Sprint Candidates

Potential upcoming sprints (planning phase):
- Browser Extension (SPRINT-2025-01-BROWSER-EXTENSION.md)
- Q1 Monetization Platform (SPRINT-2025-Q1-monetization-platform.md)
- Phase 1 Planning (sprint-plan-phase-1.md)

## How This Works

When a sprint becomes active:
1. Move/copy the sprint plan to docs/sprints/SPRINT-YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
2. Update this file to reference it: `See: SPRINT-YYYY-MM-DD-name.md`
3. The synthesis loader will pick up the active sprint automatically
4. When complete, add retrospective and archive to docs/sprints/archive/

When working from backlog only (like now):
- This file serves as the placeholder
- `ginko start` synthesis will fall back to loading active backlog items
- Work remains visible through session logs and git history

## Session Log Integration

Even without a sprint, context is maintained through:
- **Session logs**: `.ginko/sessions/{user}/current-session-log.md`
- **Backlog items**: Referenced via TASK-XXX, FEATURE-XXX in session logs
- **Strategic loading**: Context loader follows references automatically

*This file exists to prevent `ginko start` from loading stale sprint context. When a sprint is active, update this file to point to it.*
