# Sprint e021_s03: Section Iterations

## Sprint Goal

Apply the selected hero direction to key landing page sections. Focus on the highest-impact sections: Problem ("Sound familiar?"), Solution ("How ginko works"), and Features.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Problem Section ("Sound familiar?")
- [ ] Alternating background treatment (page color ↔ cream)
- [ ] Pain point cards with new styling
- [ ] Consider scroll-triggered text spotlight here
- [ ] Emotional impact should increase, not decrease

### Task 2: Solution Section ("How ginko works")
- [ ] Step-by-step visual treatment
- [ ] Terminal/code elements with new styling
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Consider isometric-style illustrations (Browserbase-inspired)

### Task 3: Features Section
- [ ] Feature cards with Lucide icons
- [ ] Colored icon backgrounds (soft gradient glow)
- [ ] Grid layout exploration
- [ ] Sunset stripe accents on cards

### Task 4: Pricing Section
- [ ] Isometric cube icons (like Browserbase pricing)
- [ ] Card treatments with new palette
- [ ] "Most popular" highlight with page accent color

### Task 5: Section Transitions
- [ ] Divider treatments between sections
- [ ] Halftone/dither transitions (Hiro-style)
- [ ] Consistent rhythm and spacing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 4 key sections styled with new brand
- [ ] Sections flow together cohesively
- [ ] Alternating background pattern works
- [ ] Mobile considerations noted (not fully designed)
- [ ] Interactive elements planned

## Notes

This is where the brand really gets tested. Individual components are easy - making them flow together as a coherent page is the hard part.
