# Sprint e021_s02: Hero Iterations

## Sprint Goal

Explore 2-3 distinct hero section treatments using the new brand foundation. Each variation should feel different enough to provide real options for Chris to react to.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Hero Variation A - "Warm Terminal"
- [ ] Cream background with dot grid pattern
- [ ] Instrument Serif headline treatment
- [ ] Keep existing terminal-style npm install CTA
- [ ] Sunset stripe accent (bottom border or divider)
- [ ] Context graph visual updated with new palette

### Task 2: Hero Variation B - "Bold Stripe"
- [ ] Full sunset gradient stripe hero (like Record truck)
- [ ] Large typography, minimal elements
- [ ] Text knockout through gradient
- [ ] More dramatic, less conventional

### Task 3: Hero Variation C - "Editorial"
- [ ] Heavy Instrument Serif headlines
- [ ] More whitespace, magazine-like layout
- [ ] Ginkgo leaf as large background element
- [ ] Sophisticated, less "startup-y"

### Task 4: Animation Exploration
- [ ] Scroll-triggered text spotlight (one hero)
- [ ] Typewriter effect (one hero)
- [ ] Subtle dot grid movement
- [ ] Test which animations feel right vs. gimmicky

### Task 5: Review & Compare
- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison view
- [ ] Document pros/cons of each
- [ ] Get Chris feedback
- [ ] Select direction for Sprint 3

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 3 distinct hero variations as HTML files
- [ ] Each uses brand foundation consistently
- [ ] At least one has interactive animation
- [ ] Comparison document with recommendations
- [ ] Direction selected for further iteration

## Notes

Don't try to make each hero "perfect." The goal is to explore different directions so we can triangulate what works. Fast and rough is better than slow and polished at this stage.
