# SPRINT-010: Git-Native Handoffs + Onboarding Execution Plan (REVISED)

**Sprint Start**: 2025-08-19 (Monday)  
**Sprint End**: 2025-08-30 (2 weeks)  
**Primary Goal**: Ship PERSONAL git-native handoffs MVP + WSL2 documentation  
**Secondary Goal**: Prepare onboarding flow for professional developers

## Critical Revision: Personal Handoffs First

Based on pre-mortem analysis, we're focusing on **personal session handoffs** first:
- One developer, multiple sessions
- No team merge conflicts
- Clear ownership model
- GitHub user ID as identifier

## User Identification Strategy

### GitHub-Based Identity
```bash
# Automatic user detection
$ git config user.name  # "Chris Norton"
$ git config user.email # "chris@ginko.ai"

# Directory structure
.ginko/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chris/                    # Personal handoff directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-handoff.md   # Current session
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/             # Historical sessions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml               # User preferences
```

**Key Insight**: Use git's existing user configuration for identity. This is already set up and familiar to developers.

## Week 1: Foundation (Aug 19-23) - REVISED

### Day 0 (Monday Morning): Critical Validation
**Owner**: Chris + Claude  
**Goal**: Validate core assumptions before building

**MUST TEST FIRST**:
- [ ] Claude can write to `.ginko/chris/session-handoff.md`

- [ ] Final end-to-end test

**Success Criteria**:
- Demo clearly shows value

- No blocking issues remain

## Pre-Mortem Integration

### Critical Failure Mitigations

#### "Git Confusion" ‚Üí Clear State Indicators
```
Statusline states:
"üìù Draft saved (not in git)"
"‚ö†Ô∏è Uncommitted changes"
"‚úÖ Committed locally"
"üîÑ Pushed to remote"
```

#### "Merge Conflicts" ‚Üí Personal Directories
```
.ginko/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chris/session-handoff.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alice/session-handoff.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bob/session-handoff.md
```
No conflicts between users!

#### "Claude Can't Read" ‚Üí Validation First
Day 1 morning: Extensive read/write testing before building features

#### "Accidental Secrets" ‚Üí Pre-commit Scanning
```gitignore
# .ginko/.gitignore
*.key
*.pem
*_secret*
.env*
```

#### "StatusLine Noise" ‚Üí Smart Filtering
Only show:
- State changes (not every save)
- Warnings (uncommitted > 30 min)
- Errors (write failed)

## Success Metrics (Revised)

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] Personal handoffs working for Chris
- [ ] No data loss incidents
- [ ] Workflow documented clearly
- [ ] WSL2 documentation complete

### Week 2 Success
- [ ] 3+ beta testers successful
- [ ] No confusion about workflow
- [ ] Positive feedback on approach
- [ ] Ready to announce publicly

### Overall Success
- [ ] Solves markdown display problem
- [ ] Enables personal session continuity
- [ ] No increase in support burden
- [ ] Foundation for team features later

## Key Decisions from Pre-Mortem

1. **Start Personal**: No team features in MVP
2. **GitHub Identity**: Use existing git config
3. **Validation First**: Test core assumptions Day 1
4. **Clear States**: Unambiguous statusline messages
5. **Safety Nets**: Backups, warnings, scanning

## Communication Plan (Revised)

### Week 1 Communications
- **Tuesday**: Internal team update on progress
- **Thursday**: Share WSL2 docs with Windows users
- **Friday**: Blog draft for review

### Week 2 Communications
- **Monday**: Beta tester recruitment
- **Wednesday**: Preview to selected developers
- **Friday**: Public launch

## The Refined Pitch

"Personal session handoffs that live in YOUR git repository, identified by YOUR GitHub identity, managed with YOUR workflow. Start solo, add team features when ready."

## Appendix: Complete Pre-Mortem Analysis

### üî¥ Critical Failure Scenarios

#### 1. The "Git Confusion" Disaster
**What Went Wrong**: Users don't understand when handoffs are "saved" vs "committed" vs "synced"
- Claude writes file ‚Üí User thinks it's done
- File not committed ‚Üí Lost on branch switch
- User rage: "I lost 3 hours of context!"

**Mitigation**:
- Clear statusline: "‚ö†Ô∏è Handoff written but not committed"
- Auto-commit option for less git-savvy users
- Prominent warnings before branch switches

#### 2. The "Merge Conflict Hell"
**What Went Wrong**: Multiple team members create conflicting handoffs

**Mitigation**: 
- Personal directories: `.ginko/chris/`
- No shared files in MVP
- Team features in v2

#### 3. The "Claude Can't Read" Problem
**What Went Wrong**: Claude can't read back edited handoffs reliably

**Mitigation**:
- Day 1 validation testing
- Abort if read/write unreliable
- Clear fallback instructions

### üü° Moderate Failure Scenarios

#### 4. The "Accidental Commit" Issue
**What Went Wrong**: Sensitive information committed to git

**Mitigation**:
- Pre-configured .gitignore
- Secrets scanning
- Review reminder in statusline

#### 5. The "Performance Degradation"
**What Went Wrong**: Large handoff files slow down git

**Mitigation**:
- 50KB warning
- Auto-archive old handoffs
- Compression for archives

#### 6. The "StatusLine Noise"
**What Went Wrong**: StatusLine becomes annoying

**Mitigation**:
- Smart filtering
- Configurable verbosity
- Easy disable option

### Success-Critical Questions (Answered)

1. **Can Claude reliably read/write to `.ginko/`?**
   - Test Day 1 morning, abort if fails

2. **Will git hooks work on all platforms?**
   - Start without hooks, add if reliable

3. **Can we detect file changes reliably?**
   - Use simple file existence first

4. **Will users understand the workflow?**
   - Test with 3 developers Week 2

5. **Can we prevent secret leakage?**
   - .gitignore + scanning from Day 1

### Key Insight from Pre-Mortem

The highest risk isn't technical - it's **conceptual confusion**. 

**Solution**: Make the first experience **magically simple** - just personal handoffs in your own directory, identified by your GitHub username.
