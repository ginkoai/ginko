# Session Handoff - MCP Tools Implementation

*Good morning! Picking up where we left off with the MCP interface simplification work. We've made excellent strategic progress and now need to complete the implementation.*

**BUILDING MODE** - Transitioning from planning ‚Üí building
*We've completed all architectural decisions and documentation. Time to execute the systematic implementation tasks we've planned out.*

## üìä Progress Snapshot
- ‚úÖ Created ADR-008 for MCP interface simplification strategy
- ‚úÖ Created ADR-009 for AI-driven handoff prompt architecture with economic impact analysis  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced handoff creation template with project context and documentation sections
- ‚úÖ Updated context tool to auto-load most recent handoff
- ‚úÖ Added loadMostRecentHandoff method to SessionHandoffManager
- ‚úÖ Published updated MCP client v0.4.0 to npm with new handoff terminology
- ‚úÖ Updated all dashboard documentation to reflect new handoff workflow
- ‚öôÔ∏è **IN PROGRESS**: Remove list_sessions tool and simplify load_handoff (partially done)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED**: Need to clean up context tool (remove team activity, use project overview internally only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED**: Update MCP client fallback tools to match simplified tool set
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING**: Test complete auto-resume flow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING**: Final commit and deployment

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Context Updates**
**System Architecture**: Confirmed template-based handoff architecture where server provides templates and Claude creates context. Zero AI inference costs for core functionality.
**Current Goals**: Complete MVP with simplified MCP interface (5 core tools) while preserving team capabilities internally for future scaling
**Key Constraints**: Must maintain backward compatibility while simplifying interface. Economic model depends on zero-cost core handoff functionality.
**Development Phase**: Building - executing systematic implementation of planned architecture changes

## üìö **Documentation Context**
**New Documentation**: 
- ADR-008: Simplify MCP Interface While Preserving Internal Capabilities
- ADR-009: AI-Driven Handoff Prompt Architecture (includes economic impact analysis)
- Enhanced handoff template with project context and documentation sections

**Key References**: 
- /api/templates/handoff-creation-template.md - The enhanced template we created
- /docs/ADRs/ADR-008-simplify-mcp-interface-preserve-capabilities.md - Strategic rationale
- /api/tools/call.ts - Main MCP tools implementation (needs cleanup)
- /packages/mcp-server/src/session-handoff.ts - Core handoff logic

**Documentation Gaps**: 
- Need updated API documentation reflecting simplified tool set
- Missing deployment guide for MCP client v0.4.0 integration

## üéØ Instant Start (WAIT FOR HUMAN GO-AHEAD)
```bash
cd /Users/cnorton/Development/ginko
git status  # Branch: fix/mvp-schema-alignment
# Remove list_sessions tool from API and replace with simplified load_handoff
# Expected: Clean tool interface with only 5 core MCP tools exposed
```

**IMPORTANT: Don't execute anything yet. Ask the human:**
- "Are these priorities still correct?"
- "Any changes to the approach?" 
- "Ready to proceed with building mode?"

## üîç Context You Need (for systematic implementation)
**Problem**: Need to complete MCP tools cleanup while preserving internal capabilities per ADR-008
**Implementation Plan**: 
1. Remove list_sessions tool entirely from /api/tools/call.ts
2. Simplify load_handoff to auto-load most recent (no session ID required)
3. Clean context tool - remove team activity, use project overview internally only
4. Update MCP client fallback tools to match (remove list_sessions, etc.)
5. Test auto-resume flow via context tool
6. Deploy and verify handoff system works end-to-end

**Last Success**: Successfully enhanced handoff template and documented architecture decisions
**Reproduce**: All tools compile and deploy successfully, handoff template is ready for testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Watchouts
- Don't remove get_project_overview implementation - keep it for internal use by context tool per ADR-008
- Ensure context tool preserves project intelligence while hiding complexity from user
- MCP client fallback tools must match server tools exactly to prevent inconsistencies

## üìü Last Terminal State
```
‚úÖ ADR-009 created successfully  
‚úÖ npm publish - ginko-mcp-client@0.4.0 published to npm
‚úÖ git commit - Enhanced handoff template and architecture documentation  
‚úÖ vercel deploy - Latest changes deployed to production
```

*Ready to complete the systematic implementation work! The architecture is solid and well-documented. Time to execute the planned tool cleanup and get the simplified interface working smoothly.*

**What would you like to focus on first - removing list_sessions or cleaning up the context tool?**
