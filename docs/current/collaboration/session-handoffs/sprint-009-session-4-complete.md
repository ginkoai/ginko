# Sprint 009 Session 4 - Collaboration Dashboard Complete

## Session Summary
Successfully completed Sprint 009 by fixing the collaboration dashboard to display real scorecard data instead of mock data. The dashboard now shows actual collaboration metrics from the database with proper field mapping and UI rendering.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Fixed API Data Flow**: Resolved team ID normalization issues preventing real data from loading
- **Corrected Field Mapping**: Database fields (`overallCollaboration`, `handoffQuality`, etc.) now properly map to React components
- **UI Polish Complete**: Fixed progress bar overflow and missing color bars for all metrics
- **Authentication Working**: Dashboard properly authenticates users and filters data by team
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all temporary debug code and hardcoded values

## Technical Context

### Critical Files Modified
- `/dashboard/src/app/api/sessions/scorecards/route.ts` - Main API endpoint with team ID normalization
- `/dashboard/src/components/dashboard/collaboration-metrics.tsx` - React component with proper field mapping
- MCP server database integration working correctly

### Database Schema
- `session_scorecards` table with JSONB scores field
- Proper RLS policies for user data access
- Auto-calculation triggers for overall scores

### Field Mappings (Database → UI)
```
overallCollaboration → Overall Score
handoffQuality → Communication  
contextEfficiency → Context Sharing
taskCompletion → Problem Solving
sessionDrift → Adaptability
```

## Current State
- **5 real scorecards** in database with actual collaboration data
- **Progress bars** displaying correctly (0-100% scale)
- **Color coding** working for all metric categories
- **Authentication** verified with chris@ginko.ai

## Next Sprint Focus
**Dashboard Consolidation**: Simplify the dashboard by combining overview, sessions, analytics, and collaboration into a single unified view.

### Consolidation Strategy
1. **Current Structure**: 4 separate pages (Overview, Sessions, Analytics, Collaboration)
2. **Target**: Single comprehensive dashboard page
3. **Key Components to Preserve**:
   - Collaboration metrics cards (working perfectly)
   - Session history with trend data
   - Coaching insights panel
   - Analytics charts (when populated)

### Implementation Notes
- Keep existing API endpoints functional
- Preserve current data fetching patterns
- Maintain responsive grid layout
- Consider progressive disclosure for detailed views

## Architecture Notes
- **Two-app system**: MCP server (mcp.ginko.ai) + Dashboard (app.ginko.ai)
- **Data flow**: Claude Code → MCP API → Supabase → Dashboard API → React UI
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with GitHub OAuth
- **Team management**: UUID-based team identification with 'default' fallback

Sprint 009 objectives fully achieved. Dashboard displaying real collaboration data with excellent user experience.
