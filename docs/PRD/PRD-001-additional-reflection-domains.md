# PRD: Additional Reflection Domains for Universal Reflection Pattern

## Executive Summary
Expand the Universal Reflection Pattern system with specialized domains for architecture, testing, UX, data modeling, and overview maintenance to provide comprehensive AI-enhanced content generation across all aspects of software development. This enhancement will enable teams to maintain consistency and quality across technical documentation, test scenarios, user experience design, data structures, and keep high-level system documentation automatically synchronized with evolving code.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
The Universal Reflection Pattern currently supports limited domains (backlog, documentation, testing, PRD). While effective, teams need specialized reflection patterns for architecture decisions, comprehensive testing strategies, UX design documentation, and data model specifications. The current implementation lacks domain-specific templates and context awareness for these critical development areas.

### User Pain Points
1. **Architecture Documentation Inconsistency**: 
   - Impact: Teams struggle to maintain consistent ADR format and quality
   - Frequency: Every architectural decision (2-3 per sprint)
   - Severity: High

2. **Test Coverage Gaps**: 
   - Impact: Missing edge cases and incomplete test scenarios
   - Frequency: Every feature implementation
   - Severity: Critical

3. **UX Documentation Fragmentation**: 
   - Impact: Design decisions lack proper documentation and rationale
   - Frequency: Every UI/UX change
   - Severity: Medium

4. **Data Model Evolution Tracking**: 
   - Impact: Schema changes lack proper documentation and migration paths
   - Frequency: Every data structure modification
   - Severity: High

5. **Stale System Documentation**: 
   - Impact: README files and architecture docs become outdated as code evolves
   - Frequency: Continuous drift with every significant change
   - Severity: Critical

### Root Cause Analysis
The lack of specialized reflection domains forces teams to use generic templates or create ad-hoc documentation, leading to inconsistency, missing context, and reduced AI assistance effectiveness. Each domain has unique requirements and patterns that aren't captured by generic approaches.

## Desired Outcomes

### User Outcomes
- Users will be able to generate domain-specific documentation with proper context and format
- Users will no longer need to manually create templates for each documentation type
- Users will experience faster, more consistent documentation creation with AI assistance

### Business Outcomes
- Increase documentation completeness by 80%
- Reduce documentation creation time by 60%
- Enable 100% AI-enhanced content generation across all domains

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Domains Supported | 4 | 13+ | Count of implemented domains |
| Documentation Time | 30 min/doc | 12 min/doc | Time tracking per document |
| Template Compliance | 40% | 95% | Automated validation |
| AI Enhancement Rate | 25% | 100% | Usage analytics |
