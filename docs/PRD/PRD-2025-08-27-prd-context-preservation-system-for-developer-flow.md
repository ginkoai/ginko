# PRD: Context Preservation System for Developer Flow

## Executive Summary
Developers lose 23% of productive time to context switching, with each interruption requiring 15-25 minutes to regain deep focus. This PRD proposes a Context Preservation System that maintains and restores developer mental state across interruptions.

## Problem Space Exploration

### Current Pain Points
- **Interruption Recovery**: After meetings/breaks, developers spend 15-25 minutes reconstructing mental models
- **Tab Explosion**: 50+ browser tabs open trying to maintain context across tasks
- **Lost Threads**: Forgetting why certain files were open or what the next step was
- **Repeated Discovery**: Re-searching for the same information multiple times per day
- **Meeting Transitions**: Complete loss of coding context when switching to/from meetings
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Context spread across IDE, browser, terminal, notes, chat

### Root Causes
- **Working Memory Limits**: Human brain can hold ~7 items; modern development requires tracking dozens
- **No Persistent Mental State**: When interrupted, mental models evaporate with no backup
- **Implicit Context**: Most important context lives in developer's head, not in tools
- **Poor Handoff Mechanisms**: Even self-handoffs (lunch break) lose critical context
- **Reactive Workflows**: Constant notifications create unpredictable interruptions

### Potential Solutions

#### Solution 1: Automated Context Capture
- **Approach**: Background service captures open files, recent commands, cursor positions
- **Pros**: Zero friction, comprehensive capture, works with existing tools
- **Cons**: Privacy concerns, storage overhead, may capture noise

#### Solution 2: Explicit Checkpoint System
- **Approach**: Developer triggers context save at natural breakpoints
- **Props**: Intentional, clean snapshots, developer controls what's saved
- **Cons**: Requires discipline, might forget during flow, manual overhead

#### Solution 3: AI-Assisted Context Reconstruction
- **Approach**: AI analyzes recent work and generates context summary on demand
- **Pros**: Intelligent filtering, natural language summaries, pattern recognition
- **Cons**: Requires AI integration, potential latency, accuracy concerns

#### Solution 4: Workspace Virtualization
- **Approach**: Entire development environment saved/restored as virtual workspace
- **Pros**: Perfect fidelity, includes all tools, instant restoration
- **Cons**: Resource intensive, complex setup, platform dependencies

#### Solution 5: Hybrid Progressive System
- **Approach**: Combine automatic capture, manual checkpoints, and AI enhancement
- **Pros**: Best of all approaches, graceful degradation, flexible
- **Cons**: More complex to implement, multiple integration points

### Trade-offs Analysis

| Approach | Implementation Effort | User Friction | Context Quality | Privacy Risk |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Automated | High | None | Medium | High |
| Checkpoint | Low | Medium | High | Low |
| AI-Assisted | Medium | Low | High | Medium |
| Virtualization | Very High | Low | Perfect | Low |
| Hybrid | High | Very Low | Very High | Medium |

### Success Metrics
- **Time to Context Recovery**: Reduce from 15-25 min to <2 min
- **Developer Satisfaction**: NPS score >50 for context features
- **Adoption Rate**: 80% of developers using system within 3 months
- **Productivity Gain**: 10-15% increase in focused coding time
- **Interruption Resilience**: Handle 5+ context switches/day without degradation

### Implementation Scope
- **MVP (2-3 weeks)**: Basic checkpoint system with manual triggers
- **Phase 2 (4-6 weeks)**: Add automatic capture and simple restoration
- **Phase 3 (6-8 weeks)**: Integrate AI summarization and enhancement
- **Full System (3-4 months)**: Complete hybrid system with all features

### Open Questions
- How to handle sensitive information in captured context?
- Should context be shared across team members?
- What's the optimal trigger for automatic captures?
- How long should context be retained?
- Integration priority: IDE vs Browser vs Terminal?
- How to measure "context quality" objectively?

## Proposed Solution: Ginko Context Preservation System

### Core Features
1. **Instant Capture** (`ginko capture`): 2-second context snapshots
2. **Smart Handoffs** (`ginko handoff`): Session state preservation
3. **Context Modules**: Persistent knowledge that travels across sessions
4. **AI Enhancement**: Intelligent context enrichment without breaking flow
5. **Git-Native Storage**: All context in version control, team shareable

### Why This Approach Wins
- **Zero Friction**: Commands complete in 2 seconds
- **Privacy First**: Everything stays local
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add intelligence
- **Tool Agnostic**: Works with any IDE/browser/terminal
- **Team Scalable**: Context becomes shared knowledge

### Next Steps
1. Implement ADR for Context Preservation Architecture
2. Create 5-day sprint plan for MVP
3. Build prototype checkpoint system
4. Gather user feedback on workflow
5. Iterate based on real usage patterns

## Conclusion
Context switching is not going away - modern development requires juggling multiple concerns. Instead of fighting it, we build tools that make context switching cheap and context restoration instant. Ginko's approach treats context as a first-class citizen that can be captured, enhanced, and restored without disrupting developer flow.
