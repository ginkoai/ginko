# AI-Powered Insights Command System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Replace traditional canned reports with an AI-powered insights command that generates contextual, relevant analytics on-demand. Like the handoff command, users can request specific insights through natural language, with AI generating both data analysis and visualizations dynamically. A community marketplace enables sharing and discovery of useful visualization patterns.

## Core Concept

### The Problem with Traditional Reporting
- **Information Overload**: Dozens of pre-built reports, most irrelevant
- **Rigid Structure**: Can't adapt to unique team needs
- **Maintenance Burden**: Each report needs updates and testing
- **Discovery Problem**: Users don't know which report to use
- **Static Views**: Can't ask follow-up questions

### The Ginko Solution: AI-First Analytics

```bash
# Instead of navigating menus for reports, just ask:
ginko insights "show me our velocity trend this sprint"
ginko insights "why did we miss our goals last week?"
ginko insights "what's blocking the team right now?"
ginko insights "compare my productivity to team average"

# Or use quick shortcuts:
Cmd+I → Interactive insights mode
Cmd+Shift+I → Team insights dashboard
```

## System Architecture

### Command Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Context Gathering]
    B --> C[AI Analysis]
    C --> D[Data Extraction]
    D --> E[Visualization Generation]
    E --> F[Interactive Display]
    F --> G[Follow-up Questions]
    G --> C
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Natural Language Interface
```typescript
interface InsightsCommand {
  // Parse user intent
  parseQuery(input: string): InsightIntent;
  
  // Gather relevant context
  gatherContext(): SessionContext;
  
  // Generate insight
  generateInsight(intent: InsightIntent, context: SessionContext): Insight;
  
  // Create visualization
  renderVisualization(insight: Insight): Visualization;
}
```

#### 2. Context-Aware Analysis
```typescript
interface ContextualInsights {
  // Automatic context loading
  currentSprint: SprintContext;
  recentSessions: SessionHistory;
  teamActivity: TeamMetrics;
  
  // Smart defaults based on context
  suggestedQueries: string[];
  relevantMetrics: Metric[];
}
```

#### 3. Dynamic Visualization Engine
```typescript
interface VisualizationEngine {
  // AI chooses best visualization type
  selectVisualizationType(data: InsightData): VisualizationType;
  
  // Generate visualization code
  generateD3Code(type: VisualizationType, data: InsightData): string;
  
  // Interactive features
  enableDrillDown: boolean;
  supportFollowUp: boolean;
}
```

## Feature Specifications

### Basic Insights Commands

# Shows: Task timeline, blockers, completion estimate
```

#### Team Analytics
```bash
ginko insights team
# Shows: Team velocity, collaboration patterns, bottlenecks

ginko insights "team health"
# Shows: Burnout indicators, workload distribution, morale signals
```

#### Project Status
```bash
ginko insights sprint

ginko insights "blockers"
# Shows: Current blockers, impact analysis, suggested solutions
```

### Advanced Queries

#### Comparative Analysis
```bash
ginko insights "compare this sprint to last"
# Generates: Side-by-side metrics, trend analysis, key differences

ginko insights "how do I compare to team"
# Generates: Personal vs team metrics, growth areas, strengths
```

#### Predictive Insights
```bash
ginko insights "will we hit our deadline?"

```

#### Root Cause Analysis
```bash
ginko insights "why are we slowing down?"
# Generates: Performance degradation analysis, contributing factors

ginko insights "what changed last week?"
# Generates: Change detection, impact analysis, correlation findings
```

## Visualization Marketplace

### Concept
A community-driven library of visualization patterns that can be shared, discovered, and reused.

### Structure
```yaml
marketplace/
  visualizations/
    velocity-chart/
      metadata.json       # Author, description, tags
      template.js        # D3.js visualization code
      example-data.json  # Sample data structure
      preview.png        # Screenshot
    
    burndown-enhanced/
      metadata.json
      template.js
      custom-styles.css
      README.md
```

### Marketplace Features

#### 1. Discovery
```typescript
interface MarketplaceSearch {
  // Find visualizations by intent
  searchByQuery(query: string): Visualization[];
  
  // Browse by category
  categories: ['productivity', 'team', 'planning', 'custom'];
  
  // Sort by popularity
  trending: Visualization[];
  mostUsed: Visualization[];
  newest: Visualization[];
}
```

#### 2. Contribution Model
```typescript
interface VisualizationContribution {
  // Submit new visualization
  submit(viz: Visualization): Promise<void>;
  
  // Community features
  rating: number;
  downloads: number;
  forks: number;
  
  // Monetization option
  pricing: 'free' | 'freemium' | 'paid';
  tipJar?: string; // Optional donations
}
```

#### 3. Integration
```bash
# Install from marketplace
ginko viz install "advanced-burndown"

# Use in insights
ginko insights "sprint progress" --viz advanced-burndown

# Create custom visualization
ginko viz create "my-custom-chart"

# Share with community
ginko viz publish "my-custom-chart"
```

## AI Visualization Generation

### How It Works

1. **Query Analysis**
   - AI determines data needs
   - Identifies visualization intent
   - Selects appropriate chart type

2. **Code Generation**
   - AI writes D3.js/Chart.js code
   - Generates responsive design
   - Adds interactivity

3. **Refinement Loop**
   ```bash
   User: "Make the trend line more prominent"
   AI: [Adjusts visualization styling]
   
   User: "Add confidence intervals"
   AI: [Enhances with statistical overlays]
   
   User: "Export as dashboard widget"
   AI: [Generates embeddable component]
   ```

### Example AI-Generated Visualization

```javascript
// AI generates this based on "show team velocity with confidence"
const velocityChart = {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: generateSprintLabels(6),
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Velocity',
      data: teamVelocity,
      borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)',
      tension: 0.1
    }, {
      label: 'Confidence Band',
      data: confidenceUpper,
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.1)',
      borderColor: 'transparent',
      fill: '+1'
    }]
  },
  options: {
    responsive: true,
    plugins: {
      tooltip: {
        callbacks: {
          afterLabel: (context) => {
            return `Confidence: ${calculateConfidence(context)}%`;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```
