# MCP Tool Assessment Report
**Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Sprint**: MCP Tool Value Assessment (13 points)  
**Methodology**: 3V Framework (Value, Viability, Vulnerability)

## Executive Summary

Current state: 19 tools with 3 working, 13 broken, 3 pure theater. Core value proposition (context loading) is completely broken. We have infrastructure but lack product focus.

## Real Customer Problems Identified

### P1: Context Rot Crisis (Core Value)
- Claude sessions lose effectiveness after ~1 hour
- Developers waste 15-30 minutes re-explaining context
- The "rapport problem" - losing flow state between sessions

### P2: "Is My Shit Working?" (Reliability) 
- Users can't tell if MCP connection is functioning
- Silent failures leave users confused

### P3: Team Knowledge Silos ($$$)
- Individual developers lose context when teammates switch projects
- No way to share discovered solutions/patterns
- Companies panic about "doing stupid faster"

### P4: Overwhelming Complexity
- Too many tools create decision paralysis
- Feature bloat obscures core value

### P5: Cold Start Problem
- New team members can't get productive quickly
- No warm starts for AI sessions

## Current Tool Assessment (19 Tools)

### CRITICAL AND WORKING (3 tools)
- `capture_session` - Manual session save
- `resume_session` - Manual session restore  
- `list_sessions` - Browse available sessions

### CRITICAL BUT BROKEN (1 tool)
- `context` - Returns useless file counts from wrong directory

### POTENTIALLY USEFUL AND WORKING (2 tools)
- `find_relevant_code` - Code discovery works
- `get_file_context` - File analysis works

### POTENTIALLY USEFUL BUT BROKEN (10 tools)
- Best practices: 6 tools (URL parsing failures)
- Team activity: 2 tools (empty DB, no git in serverless)
- Context: 2 tools (wrong directory, git unavailable)

### GARBAGE - ANALYTICS THEATER (3 tools)
- `get_dashboard_metrics` - Stub with "check back later"
- `get_file_hotspots` - Stub with "check back later"
- `get_team_analytics` - Stub with "check back later"

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Environment Mismatch**: Built for local development, deployed to serverless
2. **File-Centric Design**: Counting files instead of understanding projects
3. **Missing Infrastructure**: No git in Vercel, broken API URLs
4. **Feature Accumulation**: Added tools without validating user value

## Proposed Solution: Fresh Tool Design

### Design Principles
- Invisible continuity over manual commands
- Prescriptive methodology coaching
- Team-wide consistency
- Graceful degradation

### New Tool Set (8 Tools)

1. **`wh.startup`** (Auto-runs)
   - Loads methodology + context + team practices automatically
   - Solves P1 (context rot) and P5 (cold start)

2. **`wh.status`**
   - Connection health and data freshness
   - Solves P2 (reliability confidence)

3. **`wh.search`**
   - Smart code search with team context
   - Namespaced to avoid conflicts

4. **`wh.explain`**
   - Deep file/system understanding

5. **`wh.snapshot`**
   - Manual complex state capture

6. **`vibecheck`** (No prefix for ease of use)
   - Methodology reminder and discipline check
   - "You've been trial-and-erroring for 20 min. Time for a pre-mortem?"

7. **`wh.team`**
   - Share/retrieve team discoveries
   - Solves P3 (team knowledge)

8. **`wh.templates`**
   - One-time setup of planning/documentation templates
   - Creates `.ginko/templates/` directory

## Key Innovations

### Prescriptive Methodology Distribution
Ginko becomes an AI collaboration coach, not just a context loader. We distribute proven practices like:
- INVENTORY → CONTEXT → THINK → PLAN → PRE-MORTEM → VALIDATE → ACT → TEST → RETROSPECTIVE
- Pre-mortem technique (saved hours on security theater)
- Context rot awareness and auto-snapshot

### Invisible Continuity
- Auto-load on connection
- No manual session management needed
- Graceful offline degradation with cached context

### Namespace Safety
- `wh.` prefix prevents tool conflicts
- Exception: `vibecheck` for developer ergonomics

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Functionality
- Fix `wh.startup` to load real context (not file counts)
- Implement `wh.status` for reliability monitoring

### Week 2: Search & Explain
- Consolidate existing working tools
- Add team context layer

### Week 3: Templates & Methodology  
- Create template distribution system
- Build `vibecheck` discipline monitor

### Week 4: Polish
- Auto-snapshot on context rot detection
- Graceful offline degradation

## Metrics for Success

- **P1 Success**: Cold start time < 5 seconds with full context
- **P2 Success**: Users always know connection status
- **P3 Success**: Team practices loaded automatically
- **P4 Success**: Reduced from 19 to 8 tools
- **P5 Success**: New users productive in first session

## Action Items

1. **Immediate**: Delete analytics theater tools (3 tools)
2. **Week 1**: Fix core context loading 
3. **Week 2**: Implement health monitoring
4. **Month 1**: Complete new tool set
5. **Ongoing**: Distribute methodology coaching

## Conclusion

We have good infrastructure and real pain points to solve. By focusing on 8 well-designed tools instead of 19 broken ones, we can deliver the core value proposition: enabling teams to maintain AI rapport across sessions while following proven collaboration methodologies.

The shift from "here are tools" to "we coach you on AI collaboration" transforms Ginko from a utility to a strategic partner in team productivity.
