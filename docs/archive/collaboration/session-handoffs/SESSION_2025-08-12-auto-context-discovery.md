# Session Handoff - Auto-Context Loading Discovery

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Focus**: Testing SessionStart hooks for automatic context loading

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

1. **Fixed hook configuration** - Changed from `type: "toolUse"` to `type: "command"`
2. **Triggered SessionStart successfully** - Trust verification prompt appeared
3. **Discovered core limitation** - Hooks execute shell commands, not Claude slash commands
4. **Applied vibecheck pattern** - Recognized architecture question vs quick fix

## üîç Key Discovery

**The Problem**: `/mcp: No such file or directory`
- SessionStart hooks treat commands as shell executables
- Cannot directly execute Claude Code slash commands like `/mcp context`
- Need cross-platform solution (Windows/Mac/Linux)

## üéØ Architecture Decision Needed

### Option 1: Node.js Script
- Create `.claude/load-context.js` 
- Works wherever Node is installed
- More complex setup

### Option 2: Manual Command (MVP)
- Users run `/mcp context` once per session
- Simple, clear documentation
- No complex hooks needed

### Option 3: Wait for Enhancement
- Request Claude Code feature update
- Focus on other features meanwhile

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Trust prompt works** - One-time acceptance, this is good!
- **Hook format is correct** - Just wrong command type
- **Cross-platform critical** - Must work for all users, not just macOS

## üöÄ Next Session

Make architecture decision for auto-context loading or document manual approach as MVP.

**Status**: Clear problem definition achieved, ready for architecture decision.
