# Session Handoff Documentation

**Session ID**: `session-20250730-contextmcp-dev`  
**Created**: 2025-07-30 21:02 UTC  
**Project**: ContextMCP Development  
**Working Directory**: `/Users/cnorton/Development/contextMCP`  

## Current Session Context

### Project Status
- **Main Task**: Implemented comprehensive session handoff system for ContextMCP
- **Phase**: Testing and validation of session handoff features
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connected and operational with session persistence

### Recent Accomplishments
1. ✅ Designed and implemented complete session handoff system
2. ✅ Created SessionHandoffManager with capture/resume functionality
3. ✅ Added database schema for user_sessions, session_snapshots, session_handoffs
4. ✅ Integrated session handoff tools into remote MCP server
5. ✅ Fixed TypeScript build issues and completed compilation
6. ✅ Verified remote server is running on port 3031

### Active Features
- **Session Capture**: Analyzes working directory, git history, recent files, todos
- **Session Resume**: Generates contextual prompts and setup commands
- **Database Persistence**: Full session metadata storage with quality scoring
- **Quality Metrics**: Context quality assessment and productivity tracking

### Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/session-handoff.ts` - Core session handoff implementation
- `src/database.ts` - Database methods for session persistence
- `src/remote-server.ts` - MCP tools integration
- `database/schema.sql` - Session tables schema

### Current Working State
- Remote server running on port 3031 (PID: 37744)
- PostgreSQL database connected and initialized
- MCP configuration ready in `.mcp.json`
- All TypeScript code compiled successfully

### Open Tasks
- Test session handoff in new Claude Code session
- Validate capture_session tool functionality
- Test resume_session workflow end-to-end

### Next Steps for New Session
1. Start new Claude Code session in different terminal
2. Verify contextMCP tools are available (`capture_session`, `resume_session`, `list_sessions`)
3. Use `capture_session` to capture current state
4. Test `resume_session` with generated session ID
5. Validate context preservation and resumption quality

### Environment Setup Commands
```bash
# Database environment (if needed)
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=contextmcp
export DB_USER=contextmcp
export DB_PASSWORD=contextmcp123

# Start remote server (if not running)
node dist/remote-server.js
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Check server health
curl http://localhost:3031/health

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3031/webhook/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

## Session Handoff Instructions

**To resume this session in a new Claude Code session:**

1. Navigate to project directory: `cd /Users/cnorton/Development/contextMCP`
2. Ensure remote server is running (check PID 37744 or restart)
3. Start new Claude Code session
4. Use contextMCP tool: `capture_session` with current task context
5. Follow generated resumption prompt

**Critical Context to Preserve:**
- Session handoff system is fully implemented and ready for testing
- Database schema includes comprehensive session tracking
- Quality metrics and handoff analytics are built-in
- All build issues resolved, system is production-ready for testing

**Success Criteria for Next Session:**
- Successfully capture current session state
- Generate meaningful resumption prompt
- Demonstrate context preservation across sessions
- Validate session handoff reduces context rot problem
