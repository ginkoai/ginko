# Collaboration Workstyle Discussion

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Participants**: Chris Norton, Claude (Sonnet 4)  
**Context**: Sprint 008 - Session Handoff Enhancement

## The Question: Build vs Build-Test Workflow

Chris asked about preferred workstyle approaches:

### Option A: Build Features, Then Test/Debug Later
**Advantages:**
- Rapid forward progress
- Avoids context switching that can degrade output quality
- Good for prototyping and exploration phases

### Option B: Build/Test/Debug in One Session  
**Advantages:**
- Slower forward progress but higher quality code
- Immediate feedback loop
- Issues caught while context is fresh

## Claude's Analysis

**Preferred Approach**: Build-Test-Debug in One Session for most work

**Reasoning:**
- Catch conceptual errors while full context is fresh
- Integration issues surface immediately when they're easiest to fix
- Validate assumptions before they become embedded in the design
- Tighten feedback loop - learn from failures while mental model is complete

### When to Use Build-Test-Debug (Most Cases):
- New feature implementation
- Complex integrations 
- Anything touching multiple files/systems
- When user feedback is available during the session

### When to Use Build-Now-Test-Later (Strategic Cases):
- Well-defined, isolated features with clear interfaces
- Prototyping/exploring with expected iteration
- Time-boxed sprints needing visible progress
- Testing requires different setup/context

## Applied to Current Work

For the handoff quality assessment feature we just built:
- **Complexity**: Touches multiple systems (database, API routes, template generation)
- **Integration risk**: New database methods, tool registration, workflow changes
- **User impact**: Changes core handoff experience
- **Debugging advantage**: Full context available for tracing through complete flow

**Conclusion**: Test the quality assessment now while we have full context, rather than building more features first.

## Key Insight

Both Claude and Chris prefer the same approach: **Build-Test-Debug for complex work**, **Build-Now-Test-Later for simple/isolated features**. The decision depends on complexity and risk profile, not just personal preference.

This alignment suggests good collaboration compatibility on technical work approach.
