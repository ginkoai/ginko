- Behind-the-scenes Ginko development insights  
- Engaging with AI/dev community conversations
- Memes and cultural references that resonate with developer audience

**Sample Tweet Angles**:
- "AI doesn't make you smarter. It makes you stupid faster. ðŸ§µ on why most teams are optimizing for the wrong thing..."
- "Watching a Scrum team with GPT-4 is like watching someone with a Ferrari in first gear"
- "The real AI alignment problem isn't with the models. It's with human judgment."

### LinkedIn Strategy  
**Tone**: Reserved, collegial, positive, corporate but self-aware  
**Audience**: Higher-value enterprise customers, CTOs, VPs of Engineering  
**Content Style**:
- Professional insights on team transformation
- Case studies and strategic frameworks
- Industry trend analysis
- Thoughtful commentary on organizational change
