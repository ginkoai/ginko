## üèÉ Sprint Execution

### Day Start
- **Time**: ~8:00 AM PST
- **Context Loaded**: Yes (via `context` tool)
- **Previous Session**: Fresh start

### Work Completed

#### Task 1: Re-enable MCP Authentication
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Time Spent**: 2h 30m  
**Story Points**: 8  

**What was done**:
- Created `createOptionalAuthMiddleware()` in auth-manager.ts
- Implemented `setupMCPAuthentication()` with environment detection
- Updated simple-remote-client.ts to support API keys
- Added authentication environment variables to .env.example
- Created comprehensive test scripts
- Documented architecture decision in ADR-007

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Environment-based authentication
private setupMCPAuthentication() {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.REQUIRE_AUTH === 'true') {
    console.log('[AUTH] MCP endpoints require authentication (production mode)');
    this.app.use('/api/mcp', this.authManager.createAuthMiddleware());
  } else {
    console.log('[AUTH] MCP endpoints using optional authentication (development mode)');
    this.app.use('/api/mcp', this.authManager.createOptionalAuthMiddleware());
  }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/auth-manager.ts` - Added optional auth middleware
- `src/remote-server.ts` - Implemented environment-based auth setup
- `src/simple-remote-client.ts` - Added API key support
- `.env.example` - Added auth configuration
- `docs/architecture/ADR-007-environment-based-authentication.md` - New ADR
- `docs/setup/authentication-testing-guide.md` - Testing documentation

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Without auth header ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized
- ‚úÖ Invalid API key ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint ‚Üí 200 OK (no auth)
- ‚úÖ Development mode ‚Üí Works with/without auth

#### Task 2: Sprint Organization
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Time Spent**: 30m  
**Story Points**: Not estimated  

**What was done**:
- Created `docs/sprints/` folder structure
- Created sprint template for consistency
- Migrated existing sprint report to new structure
- Established naming convention: SPRINT-###-YYYYMMDD-focus.md

---

#### Task 3: Installer Script
**Status**: üöß Not Started  
**Time Spent**: 0h  
**Story Points**: 5  

**Next Steps**:
- Create `npx ginko-setup` command
- Auto-detect Claude Code installation
- Browser-based auth flow
- Automated .mcp.json configuration

## üêõ Issues & Blockers

None encountered. TypeScript compilation error was quickly resolved.

## üìù Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Environment-Based Authentication
- **Context**: Need to secure production while maintaining dev flexibility
- **Options Considered**: 
  1. Always require auth - Too restrictive for development
  2. Separate endpoints - Too complex to maintain
  3. Environment-based - Best balance
- **Decision**: Environment-based with optional auth in dev
- **Impact**: Zero-downtime deployment, backward compatibility

### Decision 2: Fallback User in Development
- **Context**: Unauthenticated requests in dev need context
- **Decision**: Use hardcoded "dev@localhost" with enterprise permissions
- **Impact**: Seamless local development experience

## üîÑ Code Changes Summary

### Pull Requests
- No PRs created yet (working in main branch)

### Commits (Pending)
```
- feat: Add optional authentication middleware for development
- feat: Implement environment-based MCP authentication
- feat: Add API key support to simple-remote-client
- docs: Add ADR-007 for environment-based authentication
- docs: Create authentication testing guide
- chore: Organize sprint reports into structured folder
```

## üìö Learnings & Insights

### Technical Learnings
1. **Environment Detection**: Using `process.env.REQUIRE_AUTH` provides granular control
   - **Application**: Can test production behavior locally

2. **Optional Middleware Pattern**: Graceful degradation improves developer experience
   - **Application**: Could apply to other services (analytics, monitoring)

### Process Improvements
1. **Sprint Organization**: Structured sprint folders improve discoverability
2. **Template Usage**: Consistent format aids AI context understanding

## üéØ Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Clean implementation of authentication without breaking changes
- Comprehensive testing approach with dedicated scripts
- Good documentation of architectural decisions
- Quick turnaround on technical debt elimination

### What Could Be Improved
- Could have started installer script in parallel
- Sprint velocity at 50% - need better estimation or scope

### Action Items for Next Sprint
- [x] Complete installer script implementation
- [ ] Test installer on fresh system
- [ ] Create demo video of setup process
- [ ] Consider automating API key generation

## üìà Velocity Analysis

**Sprint Velocity**: 8 story points (50% of planned)

**Velocity Trend**:
- Sprint 001: 21 points (OAuth implementation)
- Sprint 002: 8 points (Authentication)

**Factors Affecting Velocity**:
- Positive: Clear requirements, no blockers
- Negative: Underestimated installer complexity

## üîÆ Next Sprint Planning

### Recommended Focus
Based on this sprint's outcomes, the next sprint should focus on:
1. **Complete installer script** - Critical for user onboarding
2. **Best practices migration** - 8 story points waiting
3. **Session display optimization** - Quick UX win

### Backlog Grooming Notes
- Installer script is highest priority for UX
- Vibe check tool could be quick win
- Best practices migration needs database schema work

**Sprint Rating**: 7/10  
**Team Morale**: üòä High  
**Overall Assessment**: Successfully eliminated authentication technical debt with clean, backward-compatible implementation. Need to maintain momentum on UX improvements with installer script.
