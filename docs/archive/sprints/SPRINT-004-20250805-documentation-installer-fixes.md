❌ References @ginko/mcp-client (doesn't exist)
❌ Uses CONTEXTMCP_* environment variables (incompatible)
❌ Appears to work but fails when user opens Claude Code

# After (FUNCTIONAL) 
✅ Published ginko-mcp-client@0.1.0 to npm
✅ Uses MCP_* environment variables (correct format)
✅ Creates projects ready for Claude Code integration
```

### **📚 Professional Documentation Suite**
- **Complete User Journey**: Installation → Configuration → Usage → Troubleshooting
- **Interactive Elements**: Copy buttons, responsive navigation, clean UI
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 8 MCP tools documented with examples
- **Professional Presentation**: Builds user confidence and trust

### **🚀 Production Validation**
**End-to-End User Journey**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
```bash
npx create-ginko-project my-project
cd my-project  
code .
# MCP tools immediately available in Claude Code
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **NPX Installer Fixes**
```javascript
// Fixed package reference
"args": ["ginko-mcp-client"]  // ✅ Published to npm

// Fixed environment variables  
"env": {
  "MCP_SERVER_URL": "https://mcp.ginko.ai",
  "MCP_API_KEY": "...",
  "NODE_ENV": "production"
}
```

### **Dashboard Documentation Architecture**
```
/dashboard/docs/
├── page.tsx              # Getting Started Guide
├── api-reference/        # Complete MCP tools documentation
├── troubleshooting/      # Common issues and solutions
└── layout.tsx           # Navigation and responsive design
```

### **Layout Architecture Fix**
```javascript
// Dashboard Layout: Container for regular pages
<main className="flex-1 overflow-auto">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-6 py-8">
    {children}
  </div>
</main>

// Docs Layout: Break out with negative margins
<div className="flex h-full -mx-6 -my-8">
  {/* Full-width docs interface */}
</div>
```
