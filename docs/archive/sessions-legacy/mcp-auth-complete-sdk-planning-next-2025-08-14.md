# Session Handoff: MCP Authentication Complete ‚Üí SDK Planning Next

**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Current Task**: Completed MCP authentication fix, ready for Claude Code SDK exploration  
**Session Mode**: Completed debugging ‚Üí Next: Planning mode for SDK integration

---

## üìä Progress Snapshot

### ‚úÖ Completed This Session
- [x] Diagnosed MCP authentication "500 Authentication required" errors
- [x] Identified root causes: "current-user" placeholder & legacy API key format
- [x] Fixed dashboard API key generation and security flow
- [x] Implemented one-time key display with hash storage
- [x] Generated new wmcp_ format API key for Chris
- [x] Configured .mcp.json with valid credentials
- [x] Added .mcp.json to .gitignore for security
- [x] Updated backlog documentation

### üéØ Ready to Continue  
- [ ] Explore Claude Code SDK documentation
- [ ] Plan SDK integration with Ginko
- [ ] Design architecture for SDK-based features
- [ ] Identify use cases for programmatic Claude interaction

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked/Issues
- [ ] **[Info]** MCP tools in Claude Code require restart to use new API key
- [ ] **[Note]** Planning mode session - no implementation yet

## üéØ Instant Start (Next Session)

```bash
cd /Users/cnorton/Development/ginko/dashboard
git status  # Branch: feature/project-refactoring
# Start planning mode for SDK exploration
```

**IMPORTANT: Ready to proceed?** Yes - authentication fixed, ready for SDK planning

---

## üîç Implementation Context

### Key Files Modified
- **dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx**: Complete security overhaul for API keys
- **dashboard/src/app/api/generate-api-key/route.ts**: Fixed to generate wmcp_ format keys
- **.mcp.json**: Configured with Chris's valid API key and User ID
- **.gitignore**: Added .mcp.json for security

### Key Decisions Made  
1. **Decision**: Keep plain text API key transmission over HTTPS
   - **Rationale**: Industry standard (GitHub, Stripe, AWS) - hash becomes password if sent
   - **Files**: All authentication flows

2. **Decision**: One-time display pattern for API keys
   - **Rationale**: Security best practice - key can't be retrieved after generation
   - **Files**: settings/page.tsx

3. **Decision**: Remove "current-user" placeholder entirely
   - **Rationale**: MCP client requires valid UUID, placeholder causes auth failures
   - **Files**: .mcp.json configuration

### Current Architecture Notes
- **Pattern Used**: Bcrypt hash storage with prefix display
- **Integration Points**: Dashboard ‚Üí MCP Server authentication
- **Dependencies**: Supabase Auth for User ID, bcryptjs for hashing

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Watchouts & Critical Notes

### Don't Break These
- API keys must be wmcp_sk_test_ format (not cmcp_)
- User ID must be valid UUID from Supabase Auth
- Never store plain API keys in database (only hash)
- .mcp.json must not be committed (contains secrets)

### Next Session Priorities
1. **High**: Review Claude Code SDK documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk
2. **High**: Plan integration architecture with Ginko
3. **Medium**: Identify specific SDK use cases for the product
4. **Low**: Consider SDK vs MCP trade-offs

### Time Estimates
- **Planning session**: 1-2 hours
- **SDK exploration**: Focused on architecture, not implementation
- **Next milestone**: Architecture decision document

## üèÜ Session Success Summary

**Authentication Crisis Resolved**: Started with complete MCP authentication failure, ended with fully functional system using proper security practices.

**Key Insights**: 
1. The "current-user" placeholder was a critical blocker - MCP requires valid UUIDs
2. Legacy cmcp_ keys were being displayed but not actually functional
3. Dashboard was trying to show api_key field that doesn't exist (only api_key_hash stored)

**Security Win**: Implemented industry-standard one-time key display with bcrypt hash storage, matching practices of GitHub, Stripe, and AWS.

## üöÄ Next Session Setup

### Planning Mode Focus: Claude Code SDK
- **Documentation**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk
- **Goal**: Explore how SDK could enhance Ginko's capabilities
- **Questions to Answer**:
  1. What can SDK do that MCP tools cannot?
  2. How would SDK integrate with existing architecture?
  3. What use cases justify SDK over MCP approach?
  4. Performance and scaling considerations?

### Environment State
- **API Key**: wmcp_sk_test_0ahjQtO9-ffYF3tmjxv3BXiQvMBxh7CLM_lDzpLLYDc
- **User ID**: da7f4dcd-52f0-40c4-a273-58a237899f33
- **.mcp.json**: Configured and working (after Claude Code restart)
- **Dashboard**: Deployed with security fixes
