## Epic Descriptions

### EPIC-001: Strategic Context & Dynamic Adaptivity
**Goal:** Improve AI partner readiness from 6.5/10 to 7-8/10 through strategic context surfacing (charter, team activity, patterns), dynamic adaptivity (maturity detection, mode recommendations), and intelligent knowledge capture (significance detection, ADR/PRD nudging).

**Sprints:**
1. Strategic Context Surfacing (charter + team + patterns)
2. Dynamic Adaptivity (maturity detection + mode recommendations)
3. Intelligent Knowledge Capture (significance detection + ADR/PRD nudging)
4. Polish & Validation (performance + UX + comprehensive testing)

**Status:** Planning complete, ready to execute after current sprint

### EPIC-002: AI-Native Sprint Graphs
**Goal:** Redefine project collaboration for AI-native development. Replace human-centric status tracking (Jira, Linear) with AI-centric cognitive scaffolding through semantic graph relationships (NEXT_TASK, MUST_FOLLOW, MODIFIES, AVOID_GOTCHA).

**Key Insight:** *"Jira is for reporting to humans. Ginko is for working with AI."*

**Quantified Impact:**
- 5-7x faster session start (<3s vs 10-15 min)
- 10-20x fewer tokens (500 vs 5,000-10,000)
- 10x less rework (90% vs 50% decision accuracy)
- 95% reduction in duplicate work
- 300x faster onboarding (<3s vs 15-30 min)

**Phases:**
1. Core Infrastructure (NEXT_TASK, MUST_FOLLOW, MODIFIES, RECENT_ACTIVITY)
2. Pattern & Constraint Library (APPLIES_PATTERN, AVOID_GOTCHA, taxonomy)
3. Strategic Context & Dependencies (IMPLEMENTS → SOLVES, DEPENDS_ON, BLOCKED_BY)
4. Validation & Market Launch (metrics, case studies, positioning)

**Status:** Proposed, vision crystallized 2025-11-21

**Strategic Positioning:** Core differentiator - fundamentally rethinks collaboration management for AI era

### EPIC-005: Market Readiness
**Goal:** Prepare ginko for market launch with professional marketing presence and graph visualization capabilities.

**Sprints:**
1. Marketing & Landing Page (complete)
2. Graph Visualization (complete)

**Status:** Complete (2025-12-11)

### EPIC-006: Graph Explorer v2 - UX Polish & Advanced Features
**Goal:** Transform the Graph Explorer from a technical data browser into an intuitive knowledge navigation tool that non-technical users can use effectively.

**Sprints:**
1. Relationship Visualization & Navigation
2. Edit Capability & Node Management
3. UX Refinement & Accessibility

**Key Features:**
- Visible relationship lines between nodes
- In-place editing for project docs (ADR, Charter, Pattern, Gotcha)
- Proper Epic → Sprint → Task hierarchy in tree view
- Natural language search
- Mobile-responsive design

**Status:** Proposed, backlog defined 2025-12-11
