# EPIC-003: Marketing & Launch Readiness

## Vision

Position ginko as the essential tool for AI-assisted development through a cohesive brand presence that resonates with developers and their managers. Create a sustainable content pipeline that builds trust and drives organic adoption.

## Goal

Launch ginko with a modern marketing site, active social media presence, and sustainable content pipeline that drives developer adoption. Target soft launch in December 2025, hard go-live January 2026.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Marketing site redesigned with modern monospace aesthetic
- [ ] Clear value propositions for developers (70%) and managers (30%)
- [ ] Blog operational with initial "stock" content pieces
- [ ] Social media presence established on X, YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub
- [ ] Publishing workflow and schedule operational (weekly cadence)
- [ ] Analytics in place to measure engagement and trends

## Scope

### In Scope

- Marketing site redesign (www.ginkoai.com, Vercel-hosted)
- Developer-focused value messaging and CTAs
- Manager/lead value messaging (team productivity, context preservation)
- Blog section infrastructure and initial content
- Brief technical overviews and getting-started guides
- Social media account setup (X, YouTube, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Initial social content ("flow" pieces)
- Content management tooling evaluation
- Analytics and engagement tracking setup
- "Stock and flow" content strategy implementation

### Out of Scope

- Paid advertising campaigns (future consideration)
- Professional video production (basic presence only)
- Community forum or Discord server (roadmap)
- Localization/internationalization
- Mobile app presence

### Dependencies

- Style examples from Chris (required for Sprint 1 design work)
- Existing ginko branding assets
- Access to social media accounts (or creation)

## Target Audience

**Primary (70%):** Individual developers
- Using AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)
- Frustrated by context loss between sessions
- Working on complex codebases
- Value productivity and flow state

**Secondary (30%):** Engineering managers/team leads
- Concerned about team productivity with AI tools
- Want visibility into AI-assisted work
- Need to justify AI tooling investments
- Value team coordination and knowledge preservation

## Content Strategy

**Stock and Flow Model:**
- **Flow:** Short commentary pieces on social media (daily/frequent)
- **Stock:** Longer articles on blog (weekly)
- **Tone:** Collegial, helpful, developer-to-developer
- **CTA:** Subtle, end-of-content placement

## Sprint Breakdown

| Sprint | Goal | Duration | Status |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Sprint 1 | Website Redesign & Rebranding | 2 weeks | Not Started |
| Sprint 2 | Content Infrastructure & Initial Stock | 2 weeks | Not Started |
| Sprint 3 | Social Media & Publishing Pipeline | 1-2 weeks | Not Started |

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Style direction unclear:** Mitigate with early style examples and iteration
- **Content velocity unsustainable:** Start with realistic weekly cadence, build buffer
- **Social media fragmentation:** Focus on 2-3 primary platforms initially
- **Analytics paralysis:** Define 3-5 key metrics, ignore vanity metrics

## Timeline

- **December 2025:** Rolling soft launch (site live, initial content)
- **January 2026:** Hard go-live (full content pipeline operational)
