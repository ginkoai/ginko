# Feature: Ginko Browser Extension for Claude.ai

## Executive Summary
A Chrome extension that bridges the gap between browser-based Claude.ai users and git-native session management, providing context continuity, success metrics, and progressive education toward CLI power usage.

## Problem Statement

### Current Reality
- **95% of users** interact with Claude through browser (claude.ai), not CLI
- Browser sessions are ephemeral - context lost between conversations
- Users waste 25-45 minutes per session rebuilding context
- No mechanism for team knowledge sharing in browser workflow
- Token costs are 96% higher without proper context management

### User Pain Points
1. "What were we working on yesterday?"
2. "Let me explain the codebase again..."
3. "Can you search for that file we discussed?"
4. "I already told you about that bug..."
5. "How do I share this with my team?"

## Solution Design

### Core Architecture: Sidebar Companion
- Chrome extension with sidebar panel (no DOM manipulation of Claude.ai)
- Completely ToS compliant - no automation or scraping
- User-initiated actions only
- Progressive enhancement from browser to CLI

### Key Features

#### 1. Session Management
- Start/End session buttons
- Automatic time tracking
- Context preservation between sessions
- Handoff generation at session end

#### 2. Template System
- Browser-optimized prompting templates

- Context-aware suggestions
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

#### 3. Success Metrics
- Time saved calculations
- Token usage comparisons
- Problems solved counter

#### 4. GitHub Integration (Optional)
- OAuth connection
- Save handoffs to `.ginko/` directory
- Read team handoffs
- Version control for context

#### 5. Education Layer
- Prompt improvement suggestions
- Best practices tips
- CLI migration prompts (gentle)
- Efficiency comparisons

## User Journeys

```
1. Installs extension from Chrome Web Store
2. Opens Claude.ai → Extension sidebar appears
3. Clicks "Start Session" → Timer begins
4. Works on code with Claude
5. Clicks "End Session" → Handoff generated
6. Next day: Clicks "Resume" → Context restored
7. Sees "You saved 25 minutes!" → Feels successful
```

### Journey 2: Growing Developer
```
1. Uses extension for a week
2. Notices "Connect GitHub" option
3. Authorizes GitHub access
4. Handoffs now persist to repo
5. Discovers team member's handoffs
6. Learns from team patterns
7. Productivity increases measurably
```

### Journey 3: Power User Evolution
```
1. Sees "You could save 1 hour with CLI" message
2. Clicks "Learn More"
3. Tries Claude Code with --resume
4. Experiences 67% time reduction

```

## Technical Implementation

### Chrome Extension Manifest V3
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Ginko for Claude",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "sidePanel",
    "clipboardWrite",
    "identity"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://claude.ai/*"
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Ginko Session Manager"
  },
  "side_panel": {
    "default_path": "sidebar.html"
  }
}
```

### Data Flow
1. User actions in sidebar trigger events
2. Extension tracks session metadata (no Claude content)
3. Templates help structure user prompts
4. Handoffs generated from user-provided summaries
5. Optional GitHub sync for persistence

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Adoption Rate**: Extensions installed / Claude.ai users
- **Activation Rate**: Users who complete first handoff
- **Retention Rate**: Weekly active users
- **Success Rate**: Sessions with positive outcomes

### Secondary Metrics
- Average time saved per session
- Token reduction percentage
- CLI migration rate
- GitHub connection rate
- Template usage frequency

### User Satisfaction
- "Would you recommend?" NPS score
- Success story submissions
- Feature request patterns
- Support ticket volume

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
- **CSP Blocking**: Mitigated by sidebar-only approach
