# ADR-029: AI-Assisted Scaffolding System for Custom Reflectors

## Status
**PROPOSED** - 2025-09-22

## Context

The User-Defined Reflectors SDK must enable both technical developers and domain subject matter experts (SMEs) to create high-quality reflectors. Domain experts may lack coding expertise but possess deep knowledge of their field (security auditing, compliance frameworks, specialized testing methodologies).

Current challenges:
- Domain experts can't easily translate their expertise into reflector code
- Manual template creation is time-intensive and error-prone
- Quality consistency varies significantly across custom reflectors
- Developers lack domain-specific knowledge for specialized fields

The solution leverages AI's latent knowledge of various domains to assist in reflector creation, bridging the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation.

## Decision

We will implement an **AI-Assisted Scaffolding System** that uses large language models to generate reflector projects by extracting and applying domain knowledge from the AI's training data.

### Core Components

#### 1. AI Reflector Builder
```typescript
export class AIReflectorBuilder {
  async createFromIntent(intent: string, options: ScaffoldingOptions): Promise<ReflectorProject> {
    const domainAnalysis = await this.analyzeDomain(intent);
    const knowledgeBase = await this.extractDomainKnowledge(domainAnalysis);
    const scaffolding = await this.generateScaffolding(knowledgeBase, options);

    return scaffolding;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Domain Knowledge Extraction
The AI will analyze the user's intent and extract relevant domain knowledge:
- Industry frameworks (OWASP, NIST, ISO27001, GDPR, SOX)
- Best practices and methodologies
- Standard templates and formats
- Quality assessment criteria
- Common edge cases and considerations

#### 3. Progressive Scaffolding Generation
The system generates reflector components in order of complexity:
1. **Domain Analysis**: Understanding the problem space
2. **Template Generation**: AI-created templates based on domain knowledge
3. **Quality Rules**: Domain-specific scoring criteria
4. **Test Cases**: Example scenarios for validation
5. **Documentation**: Usage guides and examples

### Workflow

#### For Domain Experts (Non-Technical)

$ ginko create-reflector security-audit --guided

```

### AI Knowledge Integration

#### Domain Knowledge Base Structure
```typescript
interface DomainKnowledgeBase {
  domain: string;
  frameworks: Framework[];
  bestPractices: BestPractice[];
  templates: AITemplate[];
  qualityMetrics: QualityRule[];
  commonPitfalls: string[];
  industryStandards: Standard[];
}

interface AITemplate {
  name: string;
  purpose: string;
  sections: TemplateSection[];
  aiPrompts: AIPromptRule[];
  proceduralFallback: ProceduralTemplate;
}
```

#### AI Prompt Engineering
The system uses carefully crafted prompts to extract domain knowledge:

```typescript
const DOMAIN_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `
You are an expert in ${domain}. Create a comprehensive reflector for ${intent}.

Draw upon your knowledge of:
- Industry standards and frameworks
- Best practices and methodologies
- Common templates and formats
- Quality assessment criteria
- Typical edge cases and pitfalls

Generate:
1. Domain analysis and scope
2. Template structure with required sections
3. Quality scoring rules
4. Example use cases
5. Common validation checks

Focus on practical, actionable content that follows industry standards.
`;
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Multi-Stage Validation
1. **AI Self-Review**: AI evaluates its own generated content
2. **Template Validation**: Structural and format checking
3. **Domain Compliance**: Verification against known standards
4. **Test Generation**: Automated test cases for validation

#### Iterative Improvement
```typescript
export class QualityAssurance {
  async validateAndImprove(reflector: GeneratedReflector): Promise<ReflectorProject> {
    let currentScore = await this.scoreReflector(reflector);
    let iterations = 0;

    while (currentScore < QUALITY_THRESHOLD && iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS) {
      const improvements = await this.identifyImprovements(reflector, currentScore);
      reflector = await this.applyImprovements(reflector, improvements);
      currentScore = await this.scoreReflector(reflector);
      iterations++;
    }

    return reflector;
  }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Democratizes Reflector Creation**: Domain experts can create reflectors without coding
- **Leverages Deep AI Knowledge**: Taps into AI's training on industry standards
- **Consistent Quality**: AI applies consistent best practices across domains
- **Accelerated Development**: Reduces reflector creation time from days to minutes
- **Rich Documentation**: AI generates comprehensive usage examples and guides

### Negative
- **AI Dependency**: System requires AI availability for optimal scaffolding
- **Knowledge Currency**: AI training data may not include latest industry developments
- **Over-Generation**: AI might create overly complex templates for simple use cases
- **Validation Overhead**: Generated content requires human review and validation

### Neutral
- **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand how to effectively communicate with AI
- **Customization Needs**: Generated scaffolding may require fine-tuning
- **Resource Usage**: AI generation consumes compute resources

- Implement content filtering for inappropriate outputs

#### Generated Code Security
- Scan generated TypeScript for security vulnerabilities

- Add attribution for framework-specific content
- Implement originality checks for templates

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Manual Template Library
**Rejected**: Would require maintaining extensive template libraries and wouldn't leverage domain expertise effectively.

### 2. Rule-Based Generation
**Rejected**: Too rigid and couldn't adapt to diverse domain requirements or incorporate nuanced best practices.

### 3. Community-Driven Templates
**Considered**: Could supplement AI generation but doesn't solve the initial creation problem for new domains.

### 4. Hybrid AI + Human Review
**Selected**: Combines AI efficiency with human validation - implemented as optional review step.
