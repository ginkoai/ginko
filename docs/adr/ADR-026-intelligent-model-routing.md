# ADR-026: Intelligent Model Routing for Cost-Optimized AI Insights

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Ginko needs to provide AI-powered insights to solo developers who lack API keys while maintaining sustainable economics. Single-model approaches are either too expensive (Grok at $0.007/request) or insufficient quality (Haiku at $0.0005/request). We need an architecture that balances cost, quality, and performance.

## Decision
Implement an intelligent model routing system that:
1. Classifies queries by complexity (basic/standard/complex/realtime)
2. Routes to optimal model based on classification
3. Maintains multi-tier caching for cost reduction
4. Provides transparent, privacy-preserving processing

### Model Distribution Strategy
```yaml
Query Distribution:
  Basic (50%): Claude 3 Haiku at $0.0005/request
  Standard (30%): Claude 3.5 Sonnet at $0.006/request
  Complex (15%): Grok at $0.007/request
  Real-time (5%): Grok with web access at $0.007/request

Result:
  Average cost: $0.00345/request (51% reduction)
  Monthly cost (10K users): $345 vs $700 single-model
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **51% cost reduction** while maintaining quality
- **Sustainable free tier** at $0.0345/user/month
- **96.5% margins** on Pro tier ($10/month)
- **Quality optimization** - right model for each query
- **Fallback resilience** - multiple model options
- **Cache efficiency** - 30-40% reduction via intelligent caching

### Negative
- **Increased complexity** in routing logic
- **Latency variance** between models
- **Monitoring overhead** for multi-model system
- **Potential inconsistency** in response styles

### Neutral
- Requires contracts with multiple AI providers
- Need for continuous optimization and adjustment
- A/B testing required for weight tuning

## Implementation

### Architecture Components
1. **Query Classifier** - Determines complexity level
2. **Model Router** - Selects optimal model
3. **Response Cache** - Multi-tier caching system
4. **Quality Monitor** - Tracks satisfaction and adjusts weights
5. **Budget Manager** - Enforces cost controls

### Privacy Preservation
- Process only sanitized metrics (no code, no PII)
- Zero data retention on servers
- Results stored in user's git repository
- Full transparency on what's sent

### Rollout Plan
- Week 1: Basic routing with static weights
- Week 2: Add ML classifier and dynamic adjustment
- Week 3: Implement full caching and optimization
- Week 4: Production deployment with monitoring
