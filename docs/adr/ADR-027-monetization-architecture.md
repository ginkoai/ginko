# ADR-027: Monetization Architecture - Git-Native Privacy-First Platform

## Status
Adopted

## Context
Ginko has reached a maturity point where monetization is necessary for sustainability. Unlike competitors who build vendor silos with surface-level AI features, we need a monetization strategy that:
- Maintains our git-native philosophy (all data in user's git)
- Preserves privacy (zero-knowledge architecture)
- Provides real value to developers using AI assistants
- Creates sustainable economics without VC-growth pressures

Market analysis shows:
- AI coding assistant market growing from $15B (2025) to $99B (2034)
- 81% of developers use AI assistants, 49% daily
- Existing tools (Jira $8-17/mo, Linear $8-14/mo) not AI-native
- Developers frustrated with tool complexity and vendor lock-in

## Decision

### Core Monetization Architecture

1. **Three-Tier Pricing Model**
   ```yaml
   Free Tier:
     - Unlimited personal use
     - Single project
     - 10 AI insights/month
     - Access to free marketplace visualizations
     
   Pro Tier ($10/month):
     - Unlimited projects
     - 100 AI insights/month
     - Full marketplace access
     - Team collaboration
     - API access
     
   Enterprise ($25-50/month):
     - Custom workflows
     - SSO/SAML
     - Private marketplace
     - SLA guarantees
   ```

2. **Revenue Streams**
   - Direct subscriptions (Stripe integration)
   - Marketplace commissions (30% of paid visualizations)
   - Enterprise contracts (annual commitments)
   - Featured placements ($50/month)

3. **Privacy-First AI Architecture**
   - Customer provides own API keys (default)
   - Optional Ginko Basic AI for solo developers
   - Zero data retention on servers
   - All results stored in user's git

4. **Git-Native Philosophy**
   ```yaml
   What stays in git:
     - All project data (PRDs, handoffs, context)
     - AI insights and analytics
     - Visualization configurations
     - Team settings and preferences
   
   What Ginko stores:
     - Subscription status only
     - Hashed user ID for rate limiting
     - Aggregated usage metrics (no content)
   ```

## Architectural Components

### 1. Billing System
- Stripe for payment processing
- Webhook-based subscription management
- Feature flags for tier-based access
- Usage tracking without data retention

### 2. AI Insights Platform
- Natural language query interface
- Intelligent model routing (ADR-026)
- Customer API key management
- Optional Ginko Basic AI (sanitized metrics only)

### 3. Visualization Marketplace
- Community-driven visualization library
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Git-based distribution
- Revenue sharing system (70% creator, 30% platform)

### 4. Dashboard Enhancement
- Public session sharing (with privacy controls)
- Coaching insights display
- Team analytics (aggregated, anonymous)
- Export capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Sustainable business model** without compromising principles
- **No vendor lock-in** - users keep everything if they leave
- **Privacy preserved** - zero-knowledge architecture maintained
- **Community growth** - marketplace creates network effects
- **Competitive pricing** - 41% cheaper than Jira Premium equivalent
- **High margins** - 90%+ due to no AI costs, no data storage

### Negative
- **Implementation complexity** - multiple systems to build
- **Market education** - need to explain git-native benefits
- **Support burden** - helping non-technical users
- **Competition risk** - easy for others to copy features

### Neutral
- Requires 12-week implementation timeline
- Need for continuous marketplace curation
- Ongoing security audits for user-generated visualizations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Stripe billing integration
- Subscription management
- Feature flag system

### Phase 2: AI Insights (Weeks 3-5)
- Natural language interface
- Model routing system
- Ginko Basic AI option

### Phase 3: Marketplace (Weeks 6-8)
- Visualization infrastructure
- Creator tools
- Discovery system

### Phase 4: Dashboard (Weeks 9-10)
- Public sharing
- Team features
- Analytics display

### Phase 5: Launch (Weeks 11-12)
- Beta testing
- Documentation
- Marketing preparation

## Success Metrics

### Financial Targets
- Month 1: 100 paid users ($1,000 MRR)
- Month 6: 1,000 paid users ($10,000 MRR)
- Year 1: 2,000 paid users ($20,000 MRR)
- Year 2: 10,000 paid users ($100,000 MRR)

### Operational Metrics
- Free to paid conversion: 5%
- Monthly churn: <5%
- Support tickets: <2% of users
- Marketplace submissions: 50+/month

### User Satisfaction
- NPS score: 50+
- Feature adoption: 60%
- Daily active usage: 30%

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Low conversion | Generous free tier, clear value prop |
| High AI costs | Intelligent routing, customer API keys |
| Privacy concerns | Zero-knowledge, transparent processing |
| Vendor lock-in perception | Everything in git, portable format |
| Marketplace quality | Curation, ratings, sandboxing |

## Decision Rationale

This monetization architecture is chosen because it:

1. **Preserves core values** - Git-native, privacy-first, no lock-in
2. **Creates sustainable economics** - 90%+ margins enable growth
3. **Provides clear value** - AI insights competitors don't offer
4. **Builds defensible moats** - Network effects via marketplace
5. **Scales efficiently** - Platform economics, not product

The architecture explicitly rejects:
- Storing user data in proprietary databases
- Complex, opaque enterprise pricing
- Growth-at-all-costs VC model
- Feature gating for artificial scarcity
- Vendor lock-in tactics

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure Open Source** - Unsustainable without funding
2. **Consulting Model** - Doesn't scale
3. **Usage-Based Pricing** - Too complex for users
4. **Ads/Sponsorship** - Compromises user experience
5. **Data Monetization** - Violates privacy principles

## Decision Record

- **Date**: 2025-09-09
- **Deciders**: Founding team
- **Stakeholders**: Development team, early users
- **Outcome**: Adopted

## Review Schedule

- 30 days post-launch: Pricing validation
- 60 days: Feature adoption review
- 90 days: Full strategy assessment
- Quarterly thereafter

## Notes

This ADR represents a fundamental shift from free tool to monetized platform while maintaining the core philosophy that makes Ginko unique. The key insight is that by NOT storing user data and NOT charging for AI inference, we can offer better value at lower prices while maintaining higher margins than competitors.

The success of this strategy depends on clear communication of our unique value proposition: "Your code lives in git - why shouldn't everything else?"
