# UAT Bug Report - 2026-01-27

## Session Context
- **Tester:** chris@ginkoai.com (test account)
- **Test Project:** test-uat-project
- **Graph ID:** gin_1769555069083_c0c0b0
- **Team ID:** 687dc3c4-2981-4c71-a776-a9ce91385090
- **CLI Version:** 2.1.2

## Bugs Found

### BUG-001: Dashboard has no project selector [HIGH]
**Location:** Dashboard UI (all pages)
**Expected:** User can select which project/team to view
**Actual:** No selector - dashboard doesn't know which project to display
**Impact:** Users with multiple projects can't switch between them
**Fix:** Add project selector dropdown in dashboard header, persist selection

### BUG-002: Dashboard not filtering by project graphId [HIGH]
**Location:** Dashboard API queries (Focus, Roadmap, Graph pages)
**Expected:** Data filtered by selected project's graphId
**Actual:** Shows no data or wrong data
**Impact:** Dashboard is unusable for viewing project data
**Fix:** All dashboard queries must include graphId filter from selected team

### BUG-003: Insights page data leak [HIGH]
**Location:** Dashboard Insights page
**Expected:** Shows insights for selected project only
**Actual:** Shows data from Ginko Core Team (different project)
**Impact:** Privacy/data isolation violation
**Fix:** Filter insights by team membership and selected project

### BUG-004: Epic file created in wrong directory [MEDIUM]
**Location:** CLI epic creation flow (likely in Claude Code CLAUDE.md instructions)
**Expected:** Epic files go to `docs/epics/EPIC-XXX.md`
**Actual:** Epic files go to `docs/sprints/EPIC-XXX.md`
**Impact:** Incorrect file organization, may confuse graph loading
**Fix:** Update epic creation logic to use correct directory

### BUG-005: Duplicate team creation race condition [LOW]
**Location:** `ginko graph init` → team creation
**Evidence:** Two teams created 1 second apart with same graph_id
**Impact:** Duplicate teams in database
**Fix:** Add idempotency check before team creation (check if team with graph_id exists)

## UAT Results Summary

### CLI Flow - PASS
| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Reset local environment | PASS |

### Dashboard - BLOCKED

## Cleanup for Next Session

Test data to clean up:
```bash
# Graph cleanup (from admin account)
./scripts/cleanup-test-data.sh --graph-id gin_1769555069083_c0c0b0 --execute

# Remove test project locally (on test workstation)
rm -rf ~/test-uat-project
rm -rf ~/.ginko
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix BUG-001 and BUG-002 (project selector + graphId filtering)
2. Re-run dashboard portion of UAT
3. Continue CLI UAT with task execution workflow
