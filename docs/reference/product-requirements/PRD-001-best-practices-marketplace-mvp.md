# PRD-001: Best Practices Marketplace MVP (Phase 1)

## Document Status
**Status**: Draft  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-04  
**Owner**: Chris Norton  
**Stakeholders**: Ginko AI Development Team

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Development teams lack a standardized way to capture, share, and enforce coding best practices across projects and organizations. Current solutions are fragmented across wikis, README files, and tribal knowledge, making it difficult to maintain consistency and onboard new team members effectively.

### Solution Overview
A serverless Best Practices Marketplace that allows teams to create, manage, and adopt coding best practices as structured, searchable records. Phase 1 focuses on core CRUD operations, basic visibility controls, and simple adoption mechanisms to validate the foundational use case.

### Success Criteria
- **Adoption Rate**: 80% of Ginko MCP users create at least one best practice within 30 days
- **Usage Frequency**: Average 5+ best practice lookups per user per week
- **Content Quality**: 90% of created best practices include complete syntax examples

## Context & Background

### Why Now?
- **Serverless Migration Complete**: New serverless architecture provides scalable foundation
- **AI Development Acceleration**: Teams need structured knowledge for AI agents to consume
- **Remote Work Patterns**: Distributed teams require explicit knowledge sharing mechanisms

### Current State
- Basic best practices system exists in legacy WebSocket architecture
- Limited to simple text storage without structured metadata
- No community sharing or organizational governance features
- Manual adoption process with no enforcement mechanisms

### Market Research
- GitHub community practices show strong adoption of structured knowledge sharing
- Internal user feedback requests better discoverability and adoption controls
- Competitive analysis shows gap in AI-readable best practice formats

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Establish Foundation**: Create robust CRUD operations for best practice management
2. **Enable Discovery**: Implement basic search and filtering capabilities
3. **Support Adoption**: Provide simple adoption tracking for teams and projects

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline | Owner |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Best Practices Created | 0 | 100+ | 30 days | Engineering |
| Active Users | 0 | 50+ | 30 days | Product |
| Search Queries/Day | 0 | 200+ | 30 days | Engineering |

### Non-Goals
- **Ratings/Reviews**: Deferred to Phase 2 for community features
- **Organization Hierarchy**: Complex governance deferred to Phase 3
- **Advanced Analytics**: Basic tracking only for MVP validation

## User Research & Insights

### Target Users

                       └────────────────┘
```

### Technology Stack
| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| API Layer | Vercel Serverless Functions | Consistent with existing architecture |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Existing setup, relational data model fits |
| Authentication | Vercel Auth + GitHub OAuth | Existing integration |
| Search | PostgreSQL Full-Text Search | Simple, integrated solution for MVP |

### Database Schema Design

```sql
-- Best practices core table
CREATE TABLE best_practices (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    syntax TEXT,
    visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'private' CHECK (visibility IN ('public', 'private')),
    author_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- GitHub user ID
    author_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author_avatar VARCHAR(500),
    organization_id VARCHAR(255), -- For privacy boundaries
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    search_vector tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description)
    ) STORED
);

-- Tags (normalized)
CREATE TABLE bp_tags (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    bp_id UUID REFERENCES best_practices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tag VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Adoption tracking
CREATE TABLE bp_adoptions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    bp_id UUID REFERENCES best_practices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    project_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    adopted_by VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- GitHub user ID
    adopted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bp_visibility ON best_practices(visibility);
CREATE INDEX idx_bp_author ON best_practices(author_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bp_organization ON best_practices(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bp_search ON best_practices USING GIN(search_vector);
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_bp ON bp_tags(bp_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_tag ON bp_tags(tag);
CREATE INDEX idx_adoptions_bp ON bp_adoptions(bp_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_adoptions_project ON bp_adoptions(project_id);
```

### API Endpoint Structure

```
POST   /api/mcp/best-practices              # Create BP
GET    /api/mcp/best-practices              # List/Search BPs
GET    /api/mcp/best-practices/:id          # Get specific BP
PUT    /api/mcp/best-practices/:id          # Update BP (author only)
DELETE /api/mcp/best-practices/:id          # Delete BP (author only)

GET    /api/mcp/best-practices/search       # Search with filters
POST   /api/mcp/best-practices/:id/adopt    # Adopt BP for project
DELETE /api/mcp/best-practices/:id/adopt    # Remove adoption

GET    /api/mcp/projects/:id/best-practices # Get adopted BPs for project
```

### Integration Requirements
- **MCP Client Integration**: Update existing tools to include best practices queries
- **Authentication Service**: Extend current auth middleware for author permissions
- **Database Migration**: Add new tables to existing PostgreSQL schema

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- **Internal**: Serverless architecture completion, database schema migration
- **External**: Vercel deployment pipeline, PostgreSQL database availability

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: Must ship Phase 1 within current sprint (3 days remaining)
- **Resources**: Single developer implementation, no additional design resources
- **Scope**: Limited to core functionality, no UI beyond API responses

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Database Performance | Medium | Low | Implement proper indexing, query optimization |
| Auth Integration Complexity | High | Low | Leverage existing patterns, simple author-only permissions |
| Search Scalability | Medium | Medium | Start with PostgreSQL FTS, plan Elasticsearch migration |
