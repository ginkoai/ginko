# ContextMCP: Open Source Strategy

## Executive Summary

An **Open Core** model where essential components are open source while premium team collaboration and enterprise features remain proprietary. This strategy drives adoption, builds community trust, and creates a sustainable competitive moat.

**Year 5 Goal**: ContextMCP becomes the **de facto standard** for AI-assisted team development, with:

- **50M+ downloads** of open source components
- **10K+ active enterprise customers**
- **Thriving ecosystem** of integrations and extensions
- **Industry leadership** in development best practices

The open source strategy transforms ContextMCP from a product into a **platform and movement** that shapes how teams collaborate with AI assistants.
