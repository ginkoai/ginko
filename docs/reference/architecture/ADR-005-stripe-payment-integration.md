# ADR-005: Stripe Payment Integration

## Status
Approved

## Context
Following the billing architecture defined in ADR-004, we needed to select and implement a payment processor for subscription management. The payment system must handle:
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Multiple pricing tiers and billing intervals
- Webhook-based event processing
- Customer portal for self-service
- Usage-based billing capabilities
- Global payment method support

## Decision
We have chosen Stripe as our payment processor with the following implementation approach:

### 1. **Stripe Products and Pricing Structure**
- **Products**: Two products (Pro and Enterprise) with monthly/yearly variants
- **Pricing**: 
  - Pro: $9/month or $90/year (17% discount)
  - Enterprise: $29/month or $290/year (17% discount)
- **Trial Period**: 14 days for all paid plans

### 2. **Integration Architecture**
```typescript
// Billing Manager handles all Stripe interactions
class BillingManager {
  - Stripe SDK initialization with environment-based keys
  - Checkout session creation for new subscriptions
  - Customer portal access for self-service
  - Webhook event processing
  - Subscription status synchronization
}
```

### 3. **Webhook Event Handling**
We process the following Stripe events:
- `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription activation
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Plan changes, renewals
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Cancellations
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful payments
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payments requiring action

### 4. **Security Measures**
- Webhook signature validation using Stripe's signing secret
- API keys stored as environment variables only
- No sensitive payment data stored in our database
- All payment processing handled by Stripe's PCI-compliant infrastructure

### 5. **Customer Experience Flow**
1. User initiates upgrade through our API
2. We create a Stripe Checkout session
3. User completes payment on Stripe-hosted page
4. Webhook updates organization plan status
5. User gains immediate access to features

### 6. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Production keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

# Price IDs for each plan variant
STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRO_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Industry Standard**: Stripe is widely trusted and recognized
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent SDK and documentation
- **Global Coverage**: Supports 135+ currencies and multiple payment methods
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS Level 1 compliant, handles all regulatory requirements
- **Self-Service**: Built-in customer portal reduces support burden
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime SLA
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test mode with test cards

### Negative
- **Fees**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (standard pricing)
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration to another processor requires significant effort
- **Complexity**: Webhook handling requires careful implementation
- **Geographic Limitations**: Not available in all countries

### Neutral
- **API Versioning**: Must manage Stripe API version updates
- **Webhook Reliability**: Must implement idempotent event processing
- **Currency Handling**: All amounts in smallest currency unit (cents)

## Implementation Notes

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for webhook processing failures
- Retry logic for transient failures
- User-friendly error messages for payment failures

### Testing Strategy
- Use Stripe test mode for development/staging
- Test cards for various scenarios (success, decline, SCA)
- Webhook testing with Stripe CLI
- Integration tests for critical paths

### Monitoring
- Log all webhook events for audit trail
- Monitor webhook endpoint health
- Track subscription metrics in Stripe Dashboard
- Alert on payment failures or unusual patterns

## Alternatives Considered

1. **PayPal/Braintree**
   - Pros: Wide consumer recognition
   - Cons: More complex API, higher fees for SaaS

2. **Paddle**
   - Pros: Handles tax compliance globally
   - Cons: Higher fees (5-7%), less flexibility

3. **Chargebee**
   - Pros: Built for subscriptions
   - Cons: Additional layer of complexity, separate vendor

4. **Custom Solution**
   - Pros: Full control
   - Cons: Massive compliance burden, security risks
