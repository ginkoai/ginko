# ADR-017: AI-Driven Handoff Prompt Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional session management systems rely on server-side analysis and structured data storage to preserve context between sessions. For AI development workflows, this approach faces several challenges:

1. **Context Complexity**: AI development sessions involve nuanced problem-solving states that are difficult to capture with structured data
2. **Mode Awareness**: AI assistants operate in different cognitive modes (planning, debugging, building, learning, shipping) that affect approach and priorities
3. **Human Judgment**: Critical decisions about priorities, blockers, and next steps require human insight that servers cannot provide
4. **Template Rigidity**: Fixed templates cannot adapt to the diverse nature of development work
5. **Server Intelligence Limitations**: Servers lack the conversational context and session knowledge that AI assistants possess

Previous approaches attempted server-side context analysis, but this proved insufficient for capturing the full richness of AI-assisted development sessions.

## Decision

**Implement an AI-driven handoff prompt architecture where the server provides templates and AI assistants create the context.**

### Core Architecture
1. **Template Provider**: Server stores and serves markdown templates with placeholders
2. **AI Context Creator**: Current Claude session fills templates with actual session knowledge
3. **Human Approval Gate**: Next session waits for human go-ahead before executing
4. **Mode-Aware Handoffs**: Templates include mode selection and transition guidance

### Key Components

#### 1. File-Based Template System
```
/api/templates/handoff-creation-template.md
- Markdown template with {{variable}} placeholders
- Mode descriptions and selection guidance
- Structured sections for different context types
- Human-readable and editable without code changes
```

#### 2. Template-to-Context Flow
```
Current Claude Session:
1. Calls prepare_handoff tool
2. Receives template with mode options and guidance
3. Fills template with actual session knowledge
4. Calls store_handoff with completed content

Next Claude Session:  
1. Auto-loads handoff via context tool
2. Receives rich context with mode awareness
3. Asks human for approval before proceeding
4. Operates in specified mode with full context
```

#### 3. Mode-Aware Context
Five cognitive modes with specific approaches:
- **PLANNING**: Wide focus, explore options, consider architecture
- **DEBUGGING**: Narrow focus, isolate problems, test hypotheses  
- **BUILDING**: Step-by-step execution, follow the plan, complete tasks
- **LEARNING**: Deep exploration, understand patterns, document insights
- **SHIPPING**: Final checks, test everything, prepare deployment

## Economic Impact

- **Team Onboarding**: New developers rely on accumulated team practices and session history
- **Integration Depth**: MCP integration becomes embedded in development workflow

### Serverless Architecture Scaling Economics
System scales with usage through cost-efficient serverless architecture:

#### Variable Cost Structure
- **Vercel Functions**: Pay-per-request pricing scales from zero to enterprise
- **Supabase Storage**: Database costs scale with actual usage, not provisioned capacity  
- **Edge Distribution**: Global performance without infrastructure investment
- **Zero Idle Costs**: No servers running when not in use

#### Unit Economics Improvement with Scale
- **Template Reuse**: Single template serves thousands of handoffs with no additional cost
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Community features amortize costs across user base
- **Batch Processing**: Analytics and insights processed efficiently at scale
- **CDN Benefits**: Template and static content delivery improves with geographic distribution

### Market Positioning and Pricing Power

- **Team Onboarding**: Faster new developer ramp-up creates quantifiable ROI
- **Knowledge Retention**: Prevents context loss when developers leave teams
- **Quality Consistency**: Shared best practices reduce code review cycles and bugs

## Rationale

### Why AI-Driven Context Creation Works Better

1. **Session Knowledge**: AI assistants have complete conversational context that servers cannot access
2. **Contextual Intelligence**: Claude understands nuanced states like "we're blocked on schema design" vs "tests are failing"
3. **Mode Awareness**: AI can determine whether next session should be in planning vs debugging mode
4. **Adaptive Templates**: Same template produces different outputs based on actual session content
5. **Human Language**: Creates handoffs in natural language that humans can quickly validate

### Why Server-Side Analysis Failed

1. **Limited Context**: Servers only see file changes, not conversation context
2. **Missing Nuance**: Cannot capture subtle blockers, insights, or priority changes
3. **Static Analysis**: File diffs don't reveal cognitive state or problem-solving progress
4. **Template Rigidity**: Fixed schemas cannot adapt to diverse development scenarios

### Benefits of Template-Based Approach

- **Consistency**: All handoffs follow structured format while allowing content flexibility
- **Editability**: Templates can be updated without code changes
- **Guidance**: Templates provide mode selection guidance and section prompts
- **Completeness**: Structured sections ensure important context isn't missed
- **Human Readability**: Output is natural language, not machine data

## Implementation Details

### Template Structure
```markdown
## AVAILABLE MODES (Choose the best one for next session):
**PLANNING MODE** - Wide focus. Explore options. Consider architecture.
[Mode descriptions with when to use, tone, and approach]

## CREATE YOUR HANDOFF:
[Structured sections with guidance]
- Progress snapshot with real checkboxes
- Project context updates
